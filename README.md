## _Sensitive Reading Contents Detection_



As the rapid development of technology and the available of a large number of Internet blogs, online articles, ebooks, people tend to opt for these online materials rather than traditional means of education like books, newspapers. Our project aims to help keep users, especially children from these inappropriate contents.
