# Introduction to Data Science Project
## _Sensitive Reading Contents Detection_



As the rapid development of technology and the available of a large number of Internet blogs, online articles, ebooks, people tend to opt for these online materials rather than traditional means of education like books, newspapers. Our project aims to help keep users, especially children from these inappropriate contents.

## TEST ARTICLE:
`The FBI is committed to remaining agile in its approach to the terrorism threat, which has continued to evolve since the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. Years after these attacks, the threat landscape has expanded considerably, and international terrorism remains a serious threat. The threat of domestic terrorism also remains persistent overall, with actors crossing the line from exercising First Amendment-protected rights to committing crimes in furtherance of violent agendas.

Many factors have contributed to the evolution of the terrorism threat on both the international and domestic fronts, such as:

    Lone offenders: Terrorist threats have evolved from large-group conspiracies toward lone-offender attacks. These individuals often radicalize online and mobilize to violence quickly. Without a clear group affiliation or guidance, lone offenders are challenging to identify, investigate, and disrupt. The FBI relies on partnerships and tips from the public to identify and thwart these attacks.`
