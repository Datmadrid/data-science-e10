Sad, and yet with the full realization and appreciation that all things must pass.

In his NBC interview, Fauci alluded to how his life has been upended. He declined to compare Trump and Biden \u2014 two of the seven presidents he's advised in the course of his career. </p> <p class=\"\">\"I'd prefer not to get into that,\" he said. \"The attacks and blowback I get are just not worth it.\"</p> <p class=\"\">Still, he made clear that he relished his time advising Biden, who he said is \"completely in favor of sticking with the science, sticking with the facts, and not blaming anything but just going ahead and doing it.\"</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans gained control of the U.S. House in the midterm elections and plan to summon Fauci to testify about his role in combatting the pandemic in the new year.</p> <p class=\"\">Fauci said he would be willing to appear and face what is certain to be hostile questioning.</p> <p class=\"\">\"I have a great deal of respect for the concept of oversight \u2014 legitimate oversight \u2014 and I have no problem testifying before the Congress,\" he said. \"I can explain and defend everything I've done and I have absolutely nothing to hide.\"</p> <p class=\"\">At the press briefing, he was asked to reflect on the course of the virus and said that he did not imagine that the U.S. would see \u201ca three-year saga of suffering and death in a million Americans losing their lives.\u201d </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe thing that was most disturbing \u2026 was the continuation of multiple variants evolving over time,\u201d Fauci said.</p> <p class=\"\">Fauci said that he eventually expects the virus to reach low levels in the U.S., but the speed at which the country reaches that point depends on how many people continue to get vaccinated, as well as how many people get an updated booster shot.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe can get there with less suffering if we use the interventions that we have,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cIf you want to let nature take its course, we\u2019re ultimately going to get there but we\u2019re going to loose a lot more people than we need to.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Fauci <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/22/us/politics/fauci-retire.html\" target=\"_blank\">does not plan to retire</a>. He told NBC News he is considering various paths that include working in academia, a foundation, or possibly on his own. He said it is \"highly likely\" he will write a book. But in a departure from so many government officials-turned authors in the post-Trump era, he added it wouldn't be a tell-all.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\"What I would like to do is encourage and perhaps inspire younger people to get involved in science, medicine and public health,\" Fauci said. \"There's a danger of an anti-science movement, and I would hope that I would be able to serve as a bit of encouragement and inspiration to younger people.\"</p>"},

If the party continues to be following the Trump model and is Trumpian and doesn\u2019t go back to their more conservative roots of the traditional Republican Party, I will say, definitely that\u2019ll be a problem,\u201d he said.</p> <p class=\"\">Peters entered the 2022 cycle with a daunting task: to preserve the thinnest possible majority in what is typically a losing year for a party in control of the White House and Congress, a task made even more daunting this year by a president underwater in his approval rating and widespread economic pain throughout the country.</p> <p class=\"\">Democrats defied gravity, clinching 50 Senate seats and losing no incumbents. They can make it 51 in the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/gop-starts-boosting-walkers-runoff-calls-keep-trump-away-georgia-rcna56514\" target=\"_blank\">Dec. 6 Georgia runoff</a> if Democratic Sen.

He ignored projections that the fundamentals of the midterms would swamp Democratic senators in states like Nevada, Arizona and New Hampshire. \u201cOur numbers were actually pretty consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew we were going in a tough environment.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Apart from Trump, Peters said <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/inflation-abortion-lead-list-voter-concerns-nbc-news-exit-poll-finds-rcna56258\" target=\"_blank\">abortion was a motivating factor</a> for suburban voters and credited the party\u2019s \u201cunprecedented\u201d early investments in ground operations for the win, adding \u201cthe attacks on democracy\u201d from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/election-deniers-overwhelmingly-lost-battleground-states-rcna57058\" target=\"_blank\">the election denial folks</a>\u201d had an impact. \u201cPeople do care about that in this country.

Rick Scott, R-Fla., his counterpart who runs the Republican campaign arm. While Scott began the cycle with bold predictions of a 2010-style \"red wave,\" the soft-spoken Michigan Democrat stayed out of the limelight. While Scott <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/sen-rick-scotts-agenda-seen-challenge-mcconnell-gop-rcna17435\" target=\"_blank\">broke ranks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-rejects-senate-gop-election-head-rick-scotts-2022-agenda-rcna18176\" target=\"_blank\">released a controversial agenda</a> that became fodder for Democratic attack ads, Peters says he worked in lockstep with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer throughout the cycle.</p> <p class=\"\">Now, Scott and McConnell are engaged in an <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-re-elected-senate-gop-leader-defeating-challenge-rick-scott-rcna57487\" target=\"_blank\">ugly public clash</a> over <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/republican-infighting-escalates-poor-2022-election-results-trump-re-em-rcna57540\" target=\"_blank\">why their party failed to win the Senate</a>, with their advisers publicly questioning whether the other is doing enough to help Walker in the Georgia runoff. Scott has sought to align with the Trump wing of the party while the former president persistently attacks McConnell and blames the minority leader for the party's failures in 2022.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll just contrast that to where we are,\u201d said Peters, resisting an opportunity to gloat. \u201cClearly we\u2019re totally united in this race in Georgia. Chuck Schumer and I work very closely together, and are working closely together as a team to ensure that we get to 51.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Peters said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has committed to spending $7 million in Georgia to help Warnock, \u201cand we\u2019ll continue to make investments in various areas in Georgia going forward.\u201d He added that part of the challenge is to remind voters that Dec. 6 is Election Day, given that it\u2019s not intuitive to many.</p> <p class=\"\">And Trump, again, looms over the runoff. The former president's early endorsement of Walker enabled him to clear the Republican primary field, and he reiterated his support for the former football star in his speech announcing his 2024 presidential candidacy in Florida. \"Despite the outcome in the Senate, we cannot lose hope. And we must all work very hard for a gentleman and a great person named Herschel Walker,\u201d said Trump, who became the first Republican presidential candidate since 1992 to lose Georgia.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">Warnock, sensing an opportunity to mobilize his party\u2019s base, cut that video into a campaign ad and displayed \u201cStop Donald Trump.

{"title": "Home heating costs are on the rise but government assistance is running short", "content": "<p class=\"\">WASHINGTON \u2014 As winter temperatures arrive across America,  government officials are bracing for a surge of households unable to pay rising winter heating bills, and dwindling resources available to help cover the costs.</p> <p class=\"\">For the average household, home heating costs are <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/winterfuels.php#:~:text=The%20residential%20natural%20gas%20price,of%202022%20compared%20with%202021.\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> to rise <strong> </strong>28% \u2014 on top of double-digit increases last year \u2014 driven largely by the disruption to energy markets caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and surging demand for fossil fuels. At the same time, federally funded programs to help low-income households with those bills will have 42% less money this winter after the billions of dollars in Covid stimulus available last winter runs out.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The surge in demand and drop in aid is causing concern throughout state and federal governments. In anticipation, the White House has taken a three-prong approach the past year, said an administration official: It has urged oil companies to bolster their stockpiles; make funds available to weatherize homes and make them more energy efficient; and prepare for further releases from the country's petroleum or heating oil reserves. </p> <p class=\"\">But temperatures are already dropping and the number of households seeking assistance is already on the rise, according to interviews with more than a half dozen officials involved in programs that provide heating assistance. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing record numbers of requests this season for utility assistance and really the heating season is just beginning,\u201d said Scott Kelly, general secretary of the Massachusetts division of the Salvation Army, an international charitable organization. \u201cOur social workers are seeing people who have never needed to ask for help before, so it\u2019s definitely concerning to us. We are very concerned about what the future will hold this heating season.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Americans are getting squeezed financially on a number of other fronts with inflation that has shown little signs of abating, and the end to a number of pandemic-era assistance programs, such as the emergency rental assistance funding and the child tax credit that provided hundreds of dollars a month to households before it expired last year.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Kelly said the Salvation Army in Massachusetts has received twice as many applications as it did this time last year for its winter heating assistance program, which is aimed at those whose incomes are too high to qualify for federal assistance.</p> <p class=\"\">One of those seeking help this winter is Malonie Bernard. She said her family has been struggling to pay its utility bills with a single income from her fianc\u00e9 after she left her job at a nursing home during the pandemic to take care of her three children.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">As the temperatures have dipped into the 20s at night in her hometown of Fitchburg, she has yet to turn on the gas heat in her apartment. </p> <p class=\"\">Instead, her 9- and 12-year-old children sleep under multiple blankets in heavy pajamas and some nights she uses her body heat to keep her 11-month-old baby warm. She strategically uses space heaters, is sure to use the oven instead of the stove, and times her laundry so the dryer will help warm the house in the evening.</p> <p class=\"\">Each month, Bernard says she has to juggle what bills to pay and what ones to delay as costs have kept rising. Over the summer her electric bill for her seven-room apartment shot up to $700 one month, it had previously never gone above $200, and she\u2019s run up  an unpaid balance of about $1,000. For the winter, she\u2019s anticipating her gas bill will be well above last winter\u2019s of $600 a month \u2014 money her family doesn\u2019t have in their budget.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s so hard asking for help, but at this point, we have no choice,\u201d said Bernard. \u201cWe feel bad, as if we\u2019re taking it from someone else who really, really needs it. So we try to push it, but I said this year, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to push it.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In Colorado, the demand for assistance through the federally funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, know as LIHEAP, is expected to far outstrip the demand, said Theresa Kullen, who manages the program in Colorado. Kullen said she expects applications to be up 10% this winter on top of the 10% increase they saw last year.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about how much we can do because we know it\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s just not enough money to do what we need to do,\u201d said Kullen. \u201cWith the pandemic relief funds we were able to do so much good, and that money is now gone. And so we are taking a step backwards.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">But many of those who apply this year will find far less help available to them now that pandemic-era programs have run dry.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t step in and find some way to help the bottom third of the population pay these bills you\u2019ll see more suffering and they\u2019ll just be poor instead of being working class, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re afraid of, working-class families are afraid of becoming poor,\u201d said Mark Wolfe, \u00a0executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. \u201cYou no longer have what makes you feel lower middle class, you now feel poor, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening across the board with these inflationary increases, and it\u2019s subtle, it\u2019s quiet.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Congress has allocated $4.8 billion for heating assistance this winter through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which is $1 billion more than pre-pandemic funding levels. But that will be far less than the $8.3 billion available last year with the addition of Covid relief funds.</p> <p class=\"\">Despite the extra assistance last year, 20 million households are already behind on their utility bills owing a total of $16 billion in overdue payments \u2014 an average of $800 per household, <a href=\"https://neada.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20millionbehindPR.pdf\">according to NEADA</a>. That\u2019s up from $8 billion in utility bill debt at the start of the pandemic.</p> <p class=\"\">Energy costs are on the rise for a range of reasons. Prices for natural gas, the most common form of winter heating in the U.S., are projected to rise 28% this winter, largely because of increased demand in Europe following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to the Energy Information Administration.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The price of heating oil, which is widely used in New England, is expected to be up 27% this winter, and it will cost the average home $1,000 more this winter for heating oil than two years ago, <a href=\"https://neada.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20millionbehindPR.pdf\">according to NEADA</a>. Heating oil prices are linked to the price of crude oil, which has been increasing as a result of surging demand following the pandemic, limited refinery capacity and uncertainty in the markets from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p class=\"\">In Maine, where the majority of households rely on heating oil, officials have seen a 10% uptick in applications so far this year for its heating assistance program that provided help to 40,000 households last year. Without the Covid stimulus money this year, Maine will provide benefits to around the same number of households, but the amount they receive will be about half of last year\u2019s benefit, said Scott Thistle, a spokesman for MaineHousing.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cLast winter, we were able to provide about a tank and a half of heating benefit. This year, we\u2019re going to be able to provide them with less than a tank. Maybe if we\u2019re lucky, depending on the price of oil, we\u2019ll get two-thirds or a half a tank so it just doesn\u2019t go as far,\u201d said Thistle.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The cost of heating oil has been a particular concern for the Biden administration, said the government official. Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm have been urging oil companies to cut exports of diesel, which is chemically the same as heating oil, to keep more in the U.S. to build up stockpiles in the Northeast in case there are supply disruptions or colder-than-expected weather that leads to a surge in demand.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Heating oil and diesel inventories are at their lowest levels on record for this time of year.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The administration is also prepared to tap into the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, which has about 1 million barrels of heating oil, if necessary, the administration officials said.</p> <p class=\"\">The White House announced earlier this month it was also distributing $9 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act passed earlier this year to help 1.6 million households upgrade their homes to lower energy bills, like providing rebates to purchase a new electric stove, install new insulation or energy efficient appliances. The administration is also distributing $3.16\u00a0billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to retrofit thousands of low-incomes homes to make them more energy efficient while lowering utility bills, including installing insulation and updating heating and cooling systems.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">Longer term, the Biden administration is looking for ways to expand heat pump use and manufacturing in the U.S. and develop programs to improve building energy efficiency, according to an announcement earlier this month. </p>"},

Catherine Cortez Masto</a> and offered their endorsements.</p> <p class=\"\">The significance? They were all Republicans from the swing area of Washoe County, and some supported abortion rights, just like Cortez Masto, who lost the county in 2016. But she couldn't lose it again if she were to defeat her GOP opponent, Adam Laxalt, in what would become one of the closest races in the country. </p> <p class=\"\">The campaign's internal data moving into the fall showed that a significant number of Nevadans still didn't know Laxalt's stance on abortion, said an adviser to Cortez Masto. That underscored a vulnerability on an issue she was certain would motivate the electorate.</p> <p class=\"\">As ballots came in, Cortez Masto took the lead late last week in Washoe over Laxalt, who had called the 2020 presidential election \"rigged\" and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/laxalts-fiery-closing-pitch-illustrates-nevada-gops-trump-transformati-rcna55627\" target=\"_blank\">vowed repeatedly </a>not to work with the other side of the aisle. Cortez Masto took the opposite tack, touting her work with Republicans like Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, for instance, in one of a slew of strategic decisions, described by a campaign adviser, that led to her victory. </p> <p class=\"\">When the race was called late Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/cortez-masto-defeats-laxalt-nevada-handing-democrats-control-s-rcna54936\" target=\"_blank\">it was the win heard around the country</a>. Cortez Masto clinched Nevada, and that clinched control of the Senate for Democrats, overcoming historical trends that punish the party in the White House.</p> <p class=\"\">\"When all the national pundits said I couldn\u2019t win, I knew Nevada would prove them wrong,\" she said in a victory speech Sunday. \"Because in Nevada, no one gets left behind \u2014 and that means standing up for our families when no one else will.\"</p> <p class=\"\">Laxalt has not yet publicly addressed the race's outcome. As of Sunday evening, Laxalt had not called Cortez Masto offering a concession, according to a source familiar with the situation. He acknowledged to supporters on Twitter Saturday that he was likely to be overtaken by Cortez Masto as mail ballots were being counted, but has not updated his Twitter since.</p> <p class=\"\">NBC News reached out to a Laxalt spokesperson for comment Sunday.</p> <p class=\"\">Cortez Masto's shoring up of Washoe was critical, but it was just one part of a strategy that flew in the faces of critics who said talking about abortion and the \"big lie\" weren't winning messages. Her campaign had leaned into both themes, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/cortez-masto-says-gop-opponent-face-consequences-claiming-2020-electio-rcna53500\" target=\"_blank\">accelerating messaging about democracy </a>in the final weeks of the campaign. </p> <p class=\"\">Gas and inflation should have spelled disaster for Cortez Masto, as it did for Nevada Gov.

The Culinary Union for months unleashed canvassers who visited over 1 million doors in the neighborhoods \u2014 about double the number in the 2020 presidential election \u2014 and educated voters about mail-in ballots, abortion, rent prices and immigration laws.</p> <p class=\"\">Laxalt did dominate the state's 15 rural counties, but there just weren't enough votes to overcome Cortez Masto in Clark and Washoe counties. </p> <p class=\"\">Cortez Masto and her allies also outspent Laxalt. From the onset of the general election through Election Day, Democrats sank $82.6 million into TV, radio and digital, while Republican groups spent $70.5 million, according to AdImpact, an advertising analytics firm.</p> <p class=\"\">Aside from those factors, Laxalt had to overcome both local and national hurdles, including the fallout from the Capitol riot and a tense intraparty battle between Nevada Republicans' <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/laxalts-fiery-closing-pitch-illustrates-nevada-gops-trump-transformati-rcna55627\" target=\"_blank\">rank-and-file members</a> and those who publicly express support for Democrats.</p> <p class=\"\">Former Nevada GOP chair Amy Tarkanian said Sunday the reasons the Republican lost were simple: self-inflicted wounds.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\"You had bullying tactics, you had the election-denying being pushed ... you had so many Republicans who could see so clearly through the lies, through the deception.

If he runs, that announcement isn\u2019t expected to come until summer at the earliest \u2014 probably after Florida\u2019s legislative session ends in June \u2014 which will give him time to gauge his own chances.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s not in a hurry because he doesn\u2019t have to be. And he has a day job: governor,\u201d said one top Florida Republican who was in regular contact with DeSantis throughout his 2022 re-election campaign and spoke anonymously to relay how he believes DeSantis is thinking.</p> <p class=\"\">Dan Eberhart, a Republican fundraiser who once backed Trump but now wants DeSantis to be the party\u2019s nominee in 2024, said there's time.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf Trump is going to be in, I would like for him not to be the only national Republican candidate out there,\u201d Eberhart said. \u201cBut DeSantis isn\u2019t going to get in until after the Florida legislative session ends, at least. Anyone that gets in now runs the risk of peaking too early.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The two-part early conclusion drawn by many GOP insiders is that the only way to beat Trump is by unifying around a single alternative and that DeSantis is the best of the rest.</p> <p class=\"\">That\u2019s why the timing calculations are a bit more complicated for the lower-polling candidates, who also have to worry that the race quickly becomes a clash of titans between Trump and DeSantis with little available space for also-rans. The questions of whether and when to jump in are inexorably linked, as windows of opportunity can open and close at a moment\u2019s notice.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s early announcement for president \u2014 which he almost made before the midterm elections last week \u2014 followed nearly two years of planning, fundraising and speeches. His interest in announcing a presidential bid intensified last year when President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings dropped amid the souring economy and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Aides say his desire to run became even more earnest as he increasingly saw DeSantis as a threat and, then, as the Department of Justice opened two separate criminal investigations into him over his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and his possession and storage of sensitive documents that the federal government says he improperly handled in his post-presidency.</p> <p class=\"\">But others aren\u2019t feeling Trump\u2019s urgency.</p> <p class=\"\">Since Trump\u2019s Tuesday speech, there have been more signs of movement in the invisible primary \u2014 the behind-the-scenes battle to line up donors, endorsers and top staff \u2014 than a rush to launch.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cPeople are either waiting or scrambling to get as close to DeSantis\u2019 inner circle as possible \u2014 or they\u2019re with Trump,\u201d Eberhart said of the donor class.</p> <p class=\"\">In the world of GOP elites, the field is quickly narrowing to Trump and DeSantis, and the Florida Republican source said there is something unique about their rivalry.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe fact is Ron is different from any other Republican who might run against Trump,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cRon is in Trump\u2019s head. The other guys aren\u2019t. Ron made a red wave in the state when it didn\u2019t materialize really anywhere else. He won by a historic margin. And billionaires are basically begging him to run.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In addition to the celebrity from his big re-election win of nearly 20 points, DeSantis has an edge over some of the other possible non-Trump candidates: money. His political and campaign committees had at least $64 million in the bank, according to the most recent campaign finance data.</p> <p class=\"\">DeSantis continued to fundraise after the election but has no immediately known plans to convert the state political committee into a federal super PAC that could support his federal candidacy.</p> <p class=\"\">Florida also has a so-called resign to run law that would require DeSantis, if he qualifies to run for president, to resign as governor after the 2024 election \u2014 whether or not he wins the presidency. Legislative allies are expected to change the law during the spring lawmaking session but they\u2019re \u201cwaiting on smoke signals from the Plaza Level,\u201d said a knowledgeable legislative source referring to the Tallahassee shorthand for the location of the governor\u2019s office on the first floor of the state Capitol.</p> <p class=\"\">One reason for the other hopefuls to wait outside the ring is the hope that Trump and DeSantis bloody each other badly enough to turn the title fight into a battle royal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Former Vice President Mike Pence, who needs no introduction to voters, is on a book tour. In fact, his book came out on the same day as Trump\u2019s big announcement. He didn\u2019t watch Trump\u2019s launch speech Tuesday, according to an aide, and has said he could wait until the spring to announce whether he will run.</p> <p class=\"\">Like DeSantis, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin is expected to keep his focus on state matters, possibly until Virginia\u2019s legislative session ends in February.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">But Youngkin maintained a robust schedule on behalf of Republican candidates in the midterms, earning chits in key states, and he has a growing list of prominent GOP donors ready to back him should he join the race.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Trump appears to have noticed, targeting the governor with <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-blasts-out-racist-attack-on-virginia-gov-glenn-youngkin\">a racist, somewhat confusing, attack</a> on his social media platform.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, long viewed as having eyes on the presidency, made critical remarks of Trump on Wednesday in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/us/politics/trump-republicans-alternatives.html\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a>.

It takes more time and money for more obscure hopefuls to become familiar to voters. The GOP primary electorate is familiar with Trump and Pence from their time in the White House, and, to a lesser extent, DeSantis and even Youngkin a bit from their recent high-profile gubernatorial wins.</p> <p class=\"\">The Pence aide says there\u2019s no concern in his camp that anti-Trump donors will all flock to DeSantis.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI think that the donor base is so large that that is not a threat; I don\u2019t think there could be that level of consolidation,\u201d the Pence aide said, pointing to loyalty among the former vice president\u2019s contributors that transcends pure political calculation. \u201cThere are elements of the donor base that I think he appeals to because of his faith and his devotion in that faith that other candidates don\u2019t really appeal to.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">But would-be candidates who haven\u2019t been in the political arena as recently \u2014 former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie among them \u2014 may have to make their decisions a little more quickly. Few are tipping their hands now.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe secretary hasn\u2019t made a final decision about whether or not he will run,\u201d a person close to Pompeo said. \u201cBut that decision will be based on if he thinks it is the best place for him to serve and if the timing is correct.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Christie is <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/11/15/chris-christie-trump-governors\">clearly eager to hammer Trump</a>, but it\u2019s not clear whether that will be as a candidate or perhaps as a commentator on television. He is \u201copen to\u201d a run, said longtime adviser Mike DuHaime, who added that Christie will not jump in \u201cunless he sees a path\u201d to the nomination. Either way, DuHaime said, Trump\u2019s entry has no effect on Christie\u2019s thinking and no decision is imminent.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s team has long held the position that he\u2019s expecting other Republicans to run against him and that, if a critical number of primary challengers line up, it would make his candidacy even more formidable.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe have at least 30% of the Republican primary electorate that will do anything to support the [former] president. And the value of their votes becomes proportionately higher if a bunch of others pile in the race and dilute the not-Trump vote and divide it up between them,\u201d said one Trump strategist who spoke anonymously to share the campaign\u2019s thinking.</p> <p class=\"\">In the days since Trump\u2019s launch, his campaign has released a string of endorsements from lawmakers. But the number is much lower than the set that he endorsed in the recent midterm elections, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., dodged this week when he was asked whether he backs Trump for president.</p> <p class=\"\">Steven Cheung, the communications director for Trump\u2019s campaign, said that the former president believes \u201cAmerica is in decline due to the weak leadership of Joe Biden,\u201d adding that \u201cthere are others who will be bound to the political establishment, be beholden to corporations and drag the United States into more unnecessary wars.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Brad Todd, a veteran Republican strategist, said it makes more sense for hopefuls to take their time for a variety of logistical reasons, including federal fundraising limits that are imposed once a candidacy becomes official. But more than that, he said, Republican voters are exhausted.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cCampaigns have gotten bigger and rougher and louder, and I think voters reach a capacity when they need a break,\u201d Todd said. \u201cMy advice for anyone running for anything in 2024 right now would be let the voters have their holiday.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">One GOP strategist who worked for Trump in the past said that DeSantis would be smart to stay out and let the former president see how much his own support has dissipated even without a big rival in the race.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cIf he\u2019s not in, it will just drive Trump crazy,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have all these donors, all these folks waiting for DeSantis and that\u2019s going to be their answer [when Trump asks for help]. And that\u2019s just going to twist the knife.\u201d\u00a0</p>"},

{"title": "Republicans pitched an economic solution. Now they'll have to deliver. ", "content": "<p class=\"\">WASHINGTON \u2014 Central to the Republicans' pitch to voters in the midterm elections was a pledge to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/midterm-election-inflation-economy-what-it-means-rcna56473\" target=\"_blank\">tackle high inflation </a>and bolster the economy, but a GOP \"civil war\" is brewing over what policies could accomplish those goals. </p> <p class=\"\">Having now secured some power \u2014 Republicans will control the House, NBC News projected on Wednesday \u2014 the party will have an ownership stake in the economy. </p> <p class=\"\">In a sign of how much Republicans are going to rely on the economy, former President Donald Trump, in launching his re-election campaign last Tuesday, opted to skip his usual diatribes about the 2020 election and instead tried to make the economy central to his argument about why he should be returned to power. </p> <p class=\"\">Midterm voters cited <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-inflation-rate-october-2022-economy-stands-now-rcna56272\">inflation</a> as their <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/inflation-abortion-lead-list-voter-concerns-nbc-news-exit-poll-finds-rcna56258\" target=\"_blank\">top concern, </a>with 1 in 5 saying it had caused them severe economic hardship, according to NBC News exit polls. They gave Republicans higher marks than Democrats on handling the economy.</p> <p class=\"\">While Republicans sought to seize on that economic anxiety during the campaign, most candidates provided few specifics. And Republicans appear to be divided within the party, with some calling for cutting taxes and reducing government spending and others embracing a more populist approach of protectionist trade policies and limiting immigration.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe GOP still doesn\u2019t know what its economic policy is in a post-Trump world,\u201d said Brian Riedl, who worked for six years as chief economist for Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and is now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. \u201cTen years ago it would have been spending cuts, regulatory reform, free trade and free market policies, and in a post-Trump world, all of those policies are kind of on the outs. So there\u2019s actually a bit of a civil war going on in the GOP around economics.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans will be limited in what they can achieve with control of the House because Democrats control the Senate and President Joe Biden will have veto power over legislation passed. Biden said he has no plans to change his approach to the economy, despite voters\u2019 sentiments, making a shift toward a compromise with Republicans on economic policy seemingly unlikely.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">That may mean that one of the Republicans greatest economic tools will be their ability to block further spending by Democrats in such areas as Covid response or on programs to help lower-income households, including the child tax credit and affordable housing initiatives. Republicans have argued that that type of government spending has contributed to inflation.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cLarge partisan initiatives are off the table, no one can do reconciliation, there\u2019s no path to something large where there\u2019s disagreement,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former economic adviser to George W. Bush and John McCain. \u201cThat means there will be a lot less economic policy. There will be no America Rescue Plan, no Inflation Reduction Act, things like that, and I think that would benefit the economy.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">If there is a recession, as a number of CEOs and economists have projected, Republican control of the House would likely mean that any stimulus or relief package to help struggling households and small businesses would be significantly smaller than it would be with Democrats in control given Republicans\u2019 vocal opposition to additional spending. </p> <p class=\"\">Republicans also risk facing the same type of economic blame they levied against Democrats when they face voters again in 2024.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cRepublicans are going to need to deliver on the economy, especially if the economy is worsening and inflation is worsening,\u201d said Riedl. \u201cThe Republicans will be pressured to deliver or at least put out an agenda to contrast themselves with President Biden.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans have said they would block additional taxes on corporations, such as a windfall profit tax Biden has suggested placing on oil and gas companies. But passing large tax cuts or making the Trump-era tax cuts permanent, something Republicans promised to do during the campaign, would be much more difficult because of opposition from many Democrats.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">One thing Republicans will have the power to do with control of the House is launch investigations and hearings into the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the economy. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans plan to investigate possible misuse of taxpayer dollars as part of Covid relief efforts, IRS policies and Biden\u2019s expansion of health coverage.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cOur focus is going to be on pulling the curtain back, giving the public really the right to know how their tax dollars are spent and how their government works,\u201d Brady said in an interview on Fox Business Thursday.</p> <p class=\"\">Divided control of Congress will increase the chance of another standoff over the debt ceiling that could cause the government to shut down or the U.S. to default on its debts for the first time.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI think voters should expect some unfortunate drama around raising the debt ceiling, and Republicans may try to extract some spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling,\u201d said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.</p> <p class=\"\">Inflation showed some signs of moderating earlier this week with consumer price increases easing to 7.7% in October from a year earlier and decreasing from 8.2% in September.</p> <p class=\"\">Gas prices have been a particular concern, with 65% saying the high prices have been a financial hardship for them, according to the NBC exit poll. Energy analysts and investors have said there is little that can be done from a policy standpoint to lower prices, which have been driven higher by a range of factors, including surging demand following the pandemic, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and limited refinery capacity.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Ultimately, the main factor influencing inflation would be the Federal Reserve, given its ability to raise interest rates; economic policy analysts said there's not much Congress can do even with single party control, at least not in the near term.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cThere is very little that Congress can do,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin. \u201cThey operate on years, and that\u2019s not the right timetable for inflation fighting. You have to be much more nimble. The tools they have are quite clunky. So they just need to be out of that game. That\u2019s the Federal Reserve\u2019s job now.\u201d</p>"},
{"title": "Half a world apart, Biden counters Russia by touting the alliances that Trump mocks", "content": "<p class=\"\">BALI, Indonesia \u2014 Surrounded by America\u2019s closest allies, President Joe Biden plotted a response to reports that a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-poland-missile-putin-nato-rcna57416\" target=\"_blank\">Russian-made missile </a>had hit Poland near the border with Ukraine \u2014 immediately causing alarm about possible escalation in the region.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden, speaking Wednesday local time, emerged to vow that the U.S. and its allies would \u201ccollectively determine our next steps and proceed.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Minutes later and half a world away, former President Donald Trump announced he\u2019s running again, while implying that some of the countries Biden wants to help deter Russia aren\u2019t so much allies as thieves.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI used to fight like cats and dogs with the leaders of other countries because they were stealing from us,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p class=\"\">The crisis in Poland spawned a split-screen moment highlighting two starkly different approaches to advancing America\u2019s basic foreign policy interests \u2014 between two men who could be heading for a rematch in 2024.</p> <p class=\"\">Attending a summit meeting in Bali when the missile hit Poland, Biden quickly arranged the meeting with the leaders of France, Germany, Canada and other allies. He also consulted by phone with NATO, the military alliance built to check Russian aggression after World War II.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Meanwhile, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump opened his third presidential campaign by again touting a policy that belittles collective multinational action.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe will again put America first,\u201d he said.</p> <p class=\"\">One of Biden\u2019s aims since he took office has been to repair America\u2019s network of alliances, which had fractured under Trump.<strong> </strong>He left for the trip a few days after the midterm elections, strengthened by Democratic successes that he argued sent a message to the world that Trumpism is in retreat.<strong> </strong>The crisis in Poland amounted to a chilling demonstration of why<strong> </strong>Biden feels those alliances are necessary.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden and the U.S. delegation have privately pressed foreign leaders in Bali at the Group of 20 conference of leading rich and developing countries to issue a joint statement condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The idea is to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin and show him that his war is unwinnable. Most of the leaders in attendance have agreed to sign on, a Biden administration official said.</p> <p class=\"\">As Biden aides worked to round up support, reports appeared that a Russian missile might have landed in Poland, killing two people.</p> <p class=\"\">Polish leaders convened an<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-kherson-9202c032cf3a5c22761ee71b52ff9d52\"> emergency meeting</a> as U.S. officials scrambled to learn more details. A Russian strike against Poland would widen a war that, until this point, has been confined to Ukraine. Poland is a member of NATO, whose Article 5 deems an attack on one to be an attack on all. Biden has pledged that the U.S. will defend \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/30/biden-warns-putin-on-nato-threat-as-russia-annexes-ukraine-regions.html\">every single inch</a>\u201d of NATO territory.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe, of course, are ready to stand with our NATO allies and partners,\u201d Vedant Patel, a State Department spokesman, told reporters.</p> <p class=\"\">Not long ago, it was an open question whether the U.S. would defend even one inch of NATO territory.</p> <p class=\"\">NATO, and the mutual defense obligation that underlies it, was nearly a casualty of the Trump administration. Trump often complained that members were freeloading: failing to pay the cost while expecting the U.S. to come to their defense if they were attacked (the only time Article 5 has been invoked was by the U.S. after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001).</p> <p class=\"\">During his presidency, Trump wanted to<a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/trump-discussed-pulling-u-s-from-nato-aides-say-amid-new-concerns-over-russia/\"> pull the U.S. out of NATO</a>, which would have effectively caused the alliance to unravel. He didn\u2019t follow through; NATO endured. For how long may depend on the next election. Trump\u2019s national security adviser<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/04/bolton-says-trump-might-have-pulled-us-out-nato-if-he-had-been-reelected/\"> John Bolton</a> believes that had Trump won re-election in 2020 he would have withdrawn from NATO. If Trump wins in 2024, he\u2019ll get another shot.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump still looms large in the minds of America\u2019s allies, who wonder whether he and his isolationist foreign policy approach might one day be back, Biden administration officials said.</p> <p class=\"\">An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk more freely, said, \u201cSome [U.S. allies] fear that we\u2019re the aberration, and not the other way around.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In meetings with foreign counterparts in Egypt, Cambodia and Indonesia over the past week, Biden has sought to reassure allies and demonstrate that America\u2019s commitments are ironclad. Shoring up alliances is a way to expand U.S. power in the face of threats from Russia and China.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the network of American allies is a huge multiplier of American power,\u201d said Danny Russel, a vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, who was a State Department official in the Obama administration. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one of the reasons that the U.S. is so effective as a global actor, because we have allies and partners who believe in us and are willing to stand by us.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Meeting with Southeast Asian leaders in Cambodia, the White House announced a wide-ranging $860 million package that will be used to promote clean energy, public health and education in the region.</p> <p class=\"\">At the G-20 in Bali, Biden and his foreign counterparts announced plans to expand renewable energy in Indonesia, support a solar power project in Honduras and improve public health in India, among many other projects.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cA big difference between the way this administration handles itself overseas and the previous one is our reliance on alliances and partnerships,\u201d a second senior administration official said. \u201cWe don\u2019t denigrate them, and we don\u2019t abuse them. We don\u2019t starve them of resources and attention.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Others aren\u2019t persuaded. The show-stopping event of Biden\u2019s trip wasn\u2019t any of the meetings he held with allies but rather the face-to-face meeting he had with the leader of a competitor and adversary: China. Biden\u2019s three-hour meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping may have signaled U.S. allies that as far as Biden is concerned, America\u2019s relationship with China dwarfs all else, critics contend.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Biden\u2019s meeting with Xi \u201cdoes in form and substance diminish the value of alliances and partnerships,\u201d said Steve Yates, a former aide to ex-Vice President Dick Cheney, a Republican, who is now a China expert at the America First Policy Institute, a nonprofit group led by a number of former Trump administration officials. \u201cIt gives the impression that the major powers are getting together, and that gives China unearned status.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In his announcement, Trump faulted Biden for skipping a gala dinner of G-20 leaders. \u201cEveryone flew over to wherever they flew over, and guess what?\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe never showed up. They\u2019re still looking for him.\u201d Left unsaid was that as president, Trump skipped summit meetings with Asian leaders in 2018, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his place.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden wasn\u2019t gone for long. The next day, after his emergency meeting on Poland, he attended a tree-planting ceremony, wearing his aviator sunglasses and chatting amiably with the global counterparts he\u2019ll need to pressure Russia to end the war.</p> <p class=\"\">Later, at a meeting with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the two leaders discussed Russia\u2019s missile strikes in Ukraine and the explosion in Poland as well as the challenges posed by China, climate change and securing energy supplies, the White House said.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cYou\u2019re our closest ally and our closest friend,\u201d Biden told the prime minister, \"and we appreciate that.\"\u00a0</p>"},

They also hope Biden and Xi will come away with a better sense of each other\u2019s nonnegotiable positions and \u201cred lines.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI wouldn\u2019t look at this as a meeting that will generate a specific deliverable or policy outcome,\u201d a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk more freely. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance for these two guys to continue the conversations they\u2019ve had.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">After <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosi-makes-historic-visit-taiwan-china-threats-rcna40675\" target=\"_blank\">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., visited Taiwan</a> in August, China cut off routine communications with the U.S. military in retaliation, the official said.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">That is the sort of channel the U.S. wants to preserve, the official added. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see this meeting form a foundation for keeping the channels of communication open at a lower-than-leader level.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The two countries spent weeks quietly planning the sit-down while  Biden and Xi are in Bali for a conference of the Group of 20, whose 19 countries, along with the European Union, account for about 80% of the global economy.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThere\u2019s value in leaders talking to each other,\u201d said Robert O\u2019Brien, a national security adviser in Donald Trump\u2019s White House.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden\u2019s meeting with Xi is the centerpiece of a<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/southeast-asia-biden-seeks-counter-chinas-influence-putins-war-rcna56894\"> weeklong foreign trip</a> that has also taken him to Egypt and Cambodia for meetings about the environment, the economy and global security.</p> <p class=\"\">A tough challenge for Biden will be coaxing Xi \u2014 a steely negotiator \u2014 to drop prepared talking points and engage in a more honest and free-flowing discussion, foreign policy analysts said.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t think personal diplomacy will help that much,\u201d said Victor Cha, who was a director for Asian affairs in George W. Bush\u2019s White House. \u201cEach has his set of talking points he wants to go through, and the interaction will be tense and \u2018candid.\u2019\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The two leaders, who both served as vice presidents in their respective countries, have developed a personal tie during their political ascents. Biden likes to tell a story about how they discussed the larger meaning of the U.S. in a visit to China when he was former President Barack Obama\u2019s No. 2.</p> <p class=\"\">But their relationship has faced mounting challenges since each became president. When a reporter suggested last year that they were old friends, Biden bristled and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s just<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/old-friends-xi-biden-not-necessarily-2021-11-16/\"> pure business</a>.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">While Biden is naturally garrulous and informal, experts are skeptical about his chances of luring Xi into an open-ended back and forth. (\u201cThat\u2019s not Xi\u2019s style,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.) And given the mutual suspicion in Washington and Beijing, the mood is not expected to be chummy.</p> <p class=\"\">The Biden administration sees Xi as the leader of a bullying nation with visions of global dominance. \u201cMany of our allies and partners, especially in the Indo-Pacific, stand on the frontlines of [China\u2019s] coercion and are rightly determined to seek to ensure their own autonomy, security, and prosperity,\u201d the administration said in a<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf\"> national security strategy</a> paper released last month.</p> <p class=\"\">Still, the U.S. hopes to find ways to work cooperatively with China, particularly when it comes to areas where their interests may align, like global stability. Biden will press Xi to use his influence to roll back North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, administration officials said. The hermit kingdom has been<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-launches-missiles-sea-south-korea-japan-us-drills-rcna51374\"> stepping up</a> tests of ballistic missiles, stoking fears among U.S. allies, including Japan and South Korea.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe recognize that with each launch, [the North Koreans] learn something,\u201d the senior Biden administration official said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not good for anybody in the peninsula and in the region. So the president looks forward to being able to talk about the larger international community\u2019s concerns about where things are going in Pyongyang.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">At an East Asian summit meeting Sunday, various leaders approached Biden to discuss the Democrats\u2019 success in keeping control of the Senate, said Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security adviser.</p> <p class=\"\">Rep. Andy Kim, D-N.J., a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said: \u201cLook, it will impact the confidence with which Biden goes into the conversation\u201d with Xi. \u201cNo doubt about that.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019d much rather Biden go into this conversation with the outcome we had in the midterms than if things were more difficult,\u201d he said.</p> <p class=\"\">But like Biden, Xi will also arrive having fortified his position at home. Across the table from Biden will be a Chinese president who has <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/xi-jinping-china-third-term-rcna53539\">tightened his hold</a> on the top spot after he secured a historic third term last month.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">H.R. McMaster, who was a national security adviser in the Trump White House, said Biden must deliver an unflinching message to Xi, China\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, one that leaves no doubt that the U.S. has \u201cthe resolve to compete with him and that we\u2019re not going\u00a0to back off.\u201d</p>"},

{"title": "Congress returns after the 2022 midterm election with a hectic year-end agenda", "content": "<p class=\"\">WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Congress returns to work Monday with a packed to-do list for the final weeks of the year \u2014 and control of the House still unknown.</p> <p class=\"\">The list includes reaching a government funding agreement, reauthorizing the Defense Department, passing a major election overhaul measure, codifying federal recognition of same-sex marriage and voting on nominations. And the House Jan. 6 committee is poised to wrap up its work before it dissolves.</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans underperformed expectations in the midterm elections and failed to deliver a red wave. NBC News has projected that Democrats will keep control of the Senate for two more years, while control of the House is yet to be determined.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAll I can tell you is that we are going to try to have as productive a lame-duck session as possible,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters Sunday, notifying colleagues that there will be \u201cheavy work\u201d that includes \u201clong hours.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to my caucus. I\u2019m going to talk to the Republican leadership and see what we can get done,\u201d he said.</p> <p class=\"\">Here\u2019s a rundown of the big agenda items and where they stand:</p> <p class=\"\">Before lawmakers left for recess, Congress set a Dec. 16 deadline to strike a full-year funding deal to keep the government running. That leaves about a month for the House and the Senate to come together on a package, and Democrats will need to negotiate with Republicans to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate.</p> <p class=\"\">It will be a swan song for Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Vice Chair Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who are retiring after having served in the chamber for decades.</p> <p class=\"\">Both party's leaders want to reach a deal, rejecting right-wing House Republicans' demands to punt it to next year. The GOP's midterm underperformance could deflate its hopes of holding off. </p> <p class=\"\">It's unclear when there will be an agreement and what it would look like. Among the many lingering issues is whether the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-says-needs-money-jan-6-probe-spending-bill-may-last-chance-rcna51767\" target=\"_blank\">will get the $34 million it says</a> is \"critically needed\" to continue its criminal investigation of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.</p> <p class=\"\">A package of laws to tighten the Electoral Count Act to make it harder for losing presidential candidates to steal elections has passed the House. A similar version sitting the Senate, negotiated by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, is expected to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-grapples-election-reform-legislation-time-runs-short-act-rcna46738\">get a vote in the lame-duck session</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act would revise an 1887 law to restrict the vice president\u2019s role to counting votes, lift the threshold to object to electors, bolster laws about certifying elections for the correct winner and seek to promote orderly presidential transitions. Its endorsements by Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicates it will draw broad ideological support.</p> <p class=\"\">A package of revisions to the bill easily cleared the Senate Rules and Administration Committee on a 14-1 vote in September. Some senior aides have speculated that it could be tied to the government funding bill to speed up the process; that hasn't been determined.</p> <p class=\"\">The House has passed a bipartisan bill to codify federal recognition of same-sex marriage. The Senate punted it to the lame-duck session, with the leader of the effort, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., saying the chamber needed more time to secure 60 votes.</p> <p class=\"\">Republican support has been somewhat elusive, with senators in the caucus voicing concerns about religious freedom and polygamy. Baldwin and her chief GOP co-sponsor, Collins, have emphasized that those concerns will be addressed and that the final bill would clarify that it wouldn\u2019t protect polygamous marriages.</p> <p class=\"\">Still, it remains to be seen whether the 50-member Democratic caucus can secure the minimum 10 Republican votes it needs to break a filibuster and pass the bill, which is partly an attempt to guard against fears that the conservative Supreme Court could strip protection for same-sex marriage as it did with abortion.</p> <p class=\"\">Congress must pass the annual National Defense Authorization Act, a military policy bill that structures the Pentagon. It is usually a smooth process that wins broad bipartisan support.</p> <p class=\"\">An open question this year is whether Congress will accept Manchin's recommendation to attach permitting reform \u2014 an overhaul of the process of authorizing energy and infrastructure projects \u2014 to the NDAA.</p> <p class=\"\">The House Jan. 6 committee is sunsetting at the end of the year, and members have yet to release a final report on how the Capitol attack happened and recommendations to prevent anything similar. Members have kept open the possibility of holding another hearing to roll out their findings.</p> <p class=\"\">And there are other loose ends to tie up. Before the election, the committee subpoenaed Donald Trump for documents and testimony. The former president has <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-sues-jan-6-committee-subpoena-compelling-testify-provide-documen-rcna56877\" target=\"_blank\">sued to block the subpoena</a>. That and other unfulfilled subpoenas leave committee leaders with decisions about whether to recommend criminal charges.</p> <p class=\"\">Schumer and Democrats were considering a major push to confirm judges in the lame-duck session, fearing they might lose the Senate majority and Republicans wouldn't play ball for the next two years. But the Democrats have held on to control, which alleviates pressure to rush through judges before Christmas.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">The Senate could still vote on nominations if it has time between negotiations and votes on other more pressing matters, but Democratic leaders are unlikely to keep members in through the holidays to vote on nominees they can confirm early next year.</p>"},

And I want to make sure that every country abides by the international rules of the road.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Biden\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with Xi since he took office was months in the making. It took place during a summit of the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-will-seek-establish-red-lines-high-stakes-meeting-chinas-xi-rcna56970\">Group of 20</a>, whose members account for about 80% of the global economy.</p> <p class=\"\">A readout of the meeting provided by the White House indicated Biden and Xi sought to find common ground. They agreed that the top U.S. diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, will travel to China to build on the discussion.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden told Xi that he wants to work collaboratively with China to improve public health, curb world hunger and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-cop-27-climate-change-rcna56750\" target=\"_blank\">limit global warming</a>. Senior officials on both sides will communicate with one another to make progress on those and other issues, the U.S. statement said.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden and Xi went into the meeting at a volatile moment in the world\u2019s most consequential bilateral relationship. North Korea has been stepping up missile tests \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-south-air-raid-alert-missiles-rcna55166\" target=\"_blank\">firing nearly two dozen in a single day</a> this month \u2014 and the U.S. believes China, the North\u2019s largest trading partner, should use its clout to pressure Kim to back off. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe know that Beijing has influence in Pyongyang,\u201d the North Korean capital, a senior administration official said. \u201cBeijing probably has more influence in Pyongyang than in any other capital.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In the meantime, Chinese military exercises near <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/joe-biden-china-us-forces-defend-taiwan-rcna48271\" target=\"_blank\">Taiwan</a> have raised concerns about a possible invasion of the self-governing island, which China claims as part of its territory. China was incensed over House Speaker <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pelosi-taiwan-visit-china-united-states-relationship-future-rcna41098\" target=\"_blank\">Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan</a> in August, touching off a prolonged round of drills.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe want to see cross-strait issues peacefully resolved so it never has to come to that. I\u2019m convinced that he [Xi Jinping] understood exactly what I\u2019m saying. I understood what he was saying.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Biden\u2019s dealings with Xi require a deft diplomatic touch. He needs to be both tough and conciliatory as\u00a0he tries to deter China from menacing Taiwan and bullying U.S. allies in the region while gaining Xi\u2019s cooperation in curbing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and limiting the effects of climate change.</p> <p class=\"\">Making the task even trickier, Americans largely hold a dim view of China, meaning there is little space for him to placate Beijing. More than three-quarters of U.S. adults have viewed China in an unfavorable light over the last two years, according to the<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/09/28/some-americans-views-of-china-turned-more-negative-after-2020-but-others-became-more-positive/\"> Pew Research Center</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden and Xi greeted each other cordially as the talks began. They met at about 5:40 p.m. local time (4:40 a.m. ET) in front of a row of U.S. and Chinese flags. Biden walked toward Xi with his right hand outstretched, and as they shook, he clasped Xi\u2019s hand with his left.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cGood to see you,\u201d said Biden, who met with Xi many times when both were vice presidents of their countries. They then turned and faced the cameras for a photo before they walked into the meeting room and took their seats at long, rectangular tables that faced each other across about a 12-foot gap. Each leader was flanked by nine aides. On China\u2019s side, Xi\u2019s deputies wore masks with an imprint of the country\u2019s red flag.</p> <p class=\"\">The mood was tense. Xi pointed to the pronounced differences between the world\u2019s two greatest powers in brief opening comments.</p> <p class=\"\">He told Biden that the current state of U.S.-China relations is not in the fundamental interests of the two countries and that \u201cit is not what the international community expects from us, either,\u201d the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAs leaders of two major countries, we need to play the leadership role, set the right course for the China-U.S. relationship and put it on an upward trajectory,\u201d he added.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">As reporters were ushered out of the room, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/reporter-says-was-knocked-balance-shouted-question-human-rights-ahead-rcna57061\" target=\"_blank\">a TV producer called out asking whether Biden would raise the issue of human rights</a> in China. A man from the Chinese side pulled the producer backward, causing her to lose her balance. As she was pushed toward the door, White House staff members intervened and said to leave her alone, according to a pool report of the incident.</p> <p class=\"\">Arranging the meeting took painstaking negotiation that a senior administration official hinted grew contentious at times. In their most recent phone call in July, Biden and Xi agreed that they would instruct their aides to explore an in-person meeting. The two had spoken virtually or by phone five times since Biden was sworn in.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cBoth sides had an interest in having this meeting happen,\u201d the official said.</p> <p class=\"\">A point each made in his opening remarks was that face-to-face diplomacy is imperative with so much at stake.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cAs you know, I\u2019m committed to keeping the lines of communications open between you and me personally but our governments across the board, because our two countries are \u2014 have so much that we have an opportunity to deal with,\u201d Biden said in his statement.</p>"},

Brown, who is bisexual, became the country\u2019s first openly LGBTQ governor in 2015, and Polis became the first openly gay man elected governor in 2018. (Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey, also a Democrat, was not out when he was elected to office in 2001; he came out as gay in his 2004 resignation speech.)

Craig and Davids won re-election last week, and Baldwin and Sinema aren\u2019t up for re-election until 2024.</p> <p class=\"\">Baldwin, also a lesbian, is no stranger to making political history: In 1998, she became the first openly LGBTQ nonincumbent elected to Congress when she won her House race, and in 2012, she became the first LGBTQ person ever elected to the U.S. Senate.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Sally Kohn, a political commentator and longtime LGBTQ advocate, said the success of queer women in statewide and congressional races this year is both \u201cwonderfully momentous and at the same time kind of not a big deal.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember when having an openly gay politician was scandalous, and now it\u2019s not, and that\u2019s amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we are witnessing, in spite of some backlash and grumbling from some, is overwhelmingly the United States becoming the inclusive, multiracial, pluralistic democracy it always theoretically aspired to be.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">However, she added, when something becomes \u201cmore mainstream, it\u2019s easy to forget how marginalized, invisibilized it once was.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget how much progress we\u2019ve made and not take a step back and celebrate the beautiful, better direction we continue to head in,\u201d Kohn said.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Lesbians and other queer women were successful in down-ballot races as well, according to advocacy groups and political action committees that have been tracking these races.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">LPAC supported 101 candidates \u2014\u00a0the lion\u2019s share of them lesbian and bisexual women \u2014 who appeared on general election ballots last week, and so far 77 of them won their races, with a number of races still not called.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The LGBTQ Victory Fund, a PAC that supports LGBTQ candidates across the gender and sexuality spectrum, found that queer women fared slightly better than the broader LGBTQ community: Of the races the fund tracked on Election Day, lesbian and bisexual women had a 69% success rate, while the community overall had a 61% success rate.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Annise Parker, president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund and former mayor of Houston \u2014 said last week\u2019s historic wins in statewide and congressional races were a long time coming and a reflection of the years of work queer women have put into winning down-ballot elections.</p> <p class=\"\">She compared the careers of Healey, Balint and Kotek \u2014 all of whom served years in various state-level leadership roles \u2014 with former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg.

A spokesman for Budd couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.</p> <p class=\"\">A spokesperson for Trump said that the former president is committed to helping Walker win and that the earlier 90:10 allocation<strong> </strong>was to pay for \u201cprospecting\u201d emails, covering the cost of buying a list from a third-party vendor and raising money to expand a list of potential donors. Those new donors' email addresses and their money are then shared along with the cash raised in the joint fundraising endeavor.</p> <p class=\"\">Jeff Vreeland, the executive vice president of the Republican-leaning digital firm The Prosper Group, said email fundraising has become ever more complicated since 2016 as it becomes harder to find donors in the digital world. Donors are most likely to give money for competitive races, he said, and many campaign vendors know that, so they're more likely to fail to notify campaigns like Walker\u2019s.</p> <p class=\"\">The Georgia runoff will determine whether the Senate remains evenly split at 50-50 or whether Democrats gain a seat.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for fundraisers to solicit money, and because the Georgia runoff is the only horse in town, everyone is going to try to jump on the bandwagon to try to raise money,\u201d Vreeland said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen until Dec. 6. Unfortunately, it\u2019s going to escalate.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Vreeland said two of his Republican clients, Sens. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas, worked with the Walker campaign and sent out recent joint fundraising emails with 50:50 splits. He said coordinating with a campaign ahead of time helps with messaging. By contrast, uncoordinated email solicitations can make fundraising and messaging harder.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt hurts the brand for Herschel Walker overall,\u201d he said.</p> <p class=\"\">Terry Sullivan, who was campaign manager for Sen.

Arizona presented perhaps the greatest chance for an election-denying candidate to win a swing-state governor\u2019s race this fall, with the winner having a direct role in the state\u2019s certification of the 2024 presidential vote.</p> <p class=\"\">But Arizona was subjected to some of the highest inflation rates anywhere in the country, and voters were also concerned about high numbers of undocumented immigrants crossing into the state from Mexico. In the closing weeks of her campaign, Lake focused on the economy, education and crime rather than her push to change election laws.</p> <p class=\"\">Still, election administration took center stage in the final days of the campaign, on Election Day itself and in the days that followed as election officials faced a series of snafus and votes took days to count at a slow pace. Lake and other statewide GOP candidates blasted the process, some suggesting without evidence that nefarious activity was afoot.</p> <p class=\"\">At her election night event, Lake said, \u201cWe had a big day today, and don\u2019t let those cheaters and crooks make you think anything different,\u201d adding that she predicted victory \u201cwithin hours.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe will declare victory, and we will get to work turning this around,\u201d she said. </p> <p class=\"\">Arizona Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/trump-backed-kari-lake-gets-hand-unlikely-source-arizona-democrats-rcna38084\">who boosted Lake during her primary</a>, had hoped that her refusal to moderate her stances, which include declaring an invasion at the southern border and vowing to enforce new abortion bans after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, would help Hobbs court independent voters. In Arizona, voters are essentially divided into thirds among Republicans, Democrats and independents.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Hobbs and her allies centered the campaign on abortion rights, putting Republican-endorsed restrictions at the forefront of their message. But they also sought to contrast their plans on inflation and immigration with those of Lake, a political newcomer.</p> <p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/arizona-governor-results?icid=election_usmap#vote-modes\" target=\"_blank\">NBC News exit polling bore</a> out Hobbs\u2019 theory of the case, with 58% of Arizona voters feeling either dissatisfied or angry about the Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe V. Wade and 80% of those voters casting ballots for Hobbs.</p> <p class=\"\">NBC News exit polling also found Hobbs winning the majority of independent voters and 59% of self-described moderates, who made up a plurality of the electorate. More than 70% of voters 29 and under, who made up about 12% of the electorate, backed Hobbs, who also won over a higher percentage of Republican voters than Lake won Democrats.</p> <p class=\"\">At a Trump rally in the state last month, Lake made it clear she was still fully aligned with the former president: \u201cI have some of these know-nothing consultants who say, \u2018You know, you really need to back away from President Trump right now.\u2019 And I say to them, \u2018Put down Hunter\u2019s [Biden] crack pipe right now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Days earlier, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/liz-cheney-urges-voters-reject-kari-lake-mark-finchem-rcna50960\">urged Arizonans at a forum at Arizona State University</a> not to vote for Lake because of her refusal to accept the election results should she lose, saying that if she lived in Arizona, she would back Hobbs.</p> <p class=\"\">Cheney\u2019s PAC put more than $500,000 toward an ad in Arizona that <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/liz-cheney-launches-tv-ad-targeting-arizona-election-deniers-rcna54509\" target=\"_blank\">targeted Lake</a> and fellow election denier Mark Finchem, who <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/election-denier-mark-finchem-loses-secretary-state-race-arizona-rcna56880\" target=\"_blank\">ran for</a> secretary of state.</p> <p class=\"\">Lake at the time issued a statement thanking Cheney, claiming her ad was doing \"just the opposite\" and leading to more votes.</p> <p class=\"\">\"You\u2019re welcome, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KariLake\">@KariLake</a>,\" Cheney tweeted Monday night after the election was called for Hobbs.</p> <p class=\"\">During the primary, outgoing GOP Gov. Doug Ducey, who drew Trump's ire for certifying Biden's 2020 win, condemned Lake and endorsed her Republican opponent, Karrin Taylor Robson. But Ducey and Lake patched up their relationship after her victory, and the Republican Governors Association, which Ducey chairs, spent millions to boost Lake.</p> <p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/gop-race-arizona-governor-becomes-2024-proxy-war-ducey-defies-trump-rcna37207\">Lake</a> seized on Hobbs\u2019 refusal to debate and centered it in her campaign\u2019s closing weeks. She even disrupted the start of a forum where both candidates were supposed to appear separately last month, asking that Hobbs come out and debate her, before she agreed to leave the audience until it was her turn to speak.</p> <p class=\"\">Responding to concerns from allies about her own campaign, Hobbs said last month: \u201cI am out here. I\u2019m fighting.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">NBC News has already <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/arizona-senate-race-rcna54927\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> that Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and the Democratic nominee for secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, defeated Republicans Blake Masters and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/election-denier-mark-finchem-loses-secretary-state-race-arizona-rcna56880\" target=\"_blank\">state Rep. Mark Finchem</a>, respectively. The battle for attorney general, featuring Democrat Kris Mayes and Trump-backed Republican Abraham Hamadeh, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/arizona-attorney-general-results?icid=election_statenav\" target=\"_blank\">remains too close to call</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">About the election denial movement, for which Arizona was in many ways ground zero, Hobbs said in an interview ahead of Election Day that she saw little evidence such conspiracies would recede after the votes were counted.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\"I think 2020 was the start of this long campaign,\" said Hobbs, who pledged to accept the results regardless of who won. \"And, depending on the outcome of a lot of these elections, I think it could get worse, because Kari Lake has already said she will only accept the result if she\u2019s the winner. And so I don\u2019t think any of these folks are going to go away quietly if they lose their races.\"</p>"},

Trump is preparing to do just that, with a Tuesday announcement expected at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump isn\u2019t the only Republican under scrutiny for the party\u2019s midterm failures. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, also have faced criticism for the candidates they backed and the money they spent. But Trump, who once <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/19/25-quotes-capturing-donald-trumps-final-pitch-to-south-carolina/\">assured</a> his followers that if they stuck with him they\u2019d be \u201ctired of winning,\u201d is seeing losses at the state and local levels pile up.</p> <p class=\"\">Others contend that Trump himself may no longer be a winner.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf it\u2019s Trump vs. DeSantis in Wisconsin, DeSantis would win,\u201d said Brandon Scholz, a former Wisconsin GOP chair, referring to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who won re-election in a landslide and has drawn Trump\u2019s ire by positioning himself as a 2024 alternative.</p> <p class=\"\">Wisconsin voters last week gave another term to their Democratic governor, Tony Evers, while <a href=\"https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/democratic-victories-block-republican-supermajority-in-the-wisconsin-assembly/\">denying</a> the Republicans a supermajority in the General Assembly \u2014 a major blow for Republicans eager to override vetoes.

And the wreckage is particularly profound in Michigan, where voters <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/michigan-governor-election-2022-gretchen-whitmer-wins-race-rcna55171\">re-elected</a> Democratic Gov.

All three states swung to Joe Biden in 2020 after having favored Trump in 2016.</p> <p class=\"\">In Illinois, Republicans had threatened to take two state Supreme Court seats and flip state Senate and House seats. Instead, with a Trump-backed candidate for governor at the top of the ticket, it turned even deeper blue. Jim Durkin, the longtime state House GOP leader, who decided to <a href=\"https://abc7chicago.com/jim-durkin-illinois-election-results-2022-news/12438033/\">step down</a> after last week\u2019s results were worse than expected, said \u201cTrump stopped the wave\u201d and is \u201csquarely in the blame\u201d for losses nationwide.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cTrump will say we\u2019re a bunch of RINOs,\u201d Durkin said, referring to the pejoratively used acronym for \u201cRepublicans in name only.\u201d \u201cNo, we\u2019re Republicans that want to win races.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Not everyone is pointing the finger at Trump. J.D. Vance, a Trump-endorsed Republican who won a Senate race in Ohio, wrote in a recent opinion article that it\u2019s wrong to blame Trump for an underwhelming midterm performance. Instead, he argued, Republicans\u2019 financial deficit and their inability to turn out their vote were the real problems.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe point is not that Trump is perfect,\u201d Vance wrote in <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dont-blame-trump/\">The American Conservative</a>, adding: \u201cBut any effort to pin blame on Trump, and not on money and turnout, isn\u2019t just wrong. It distracts from the actual issues we need to solve as a party over the long term.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">A spokesperson for Trump didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.</p> <p class=\"\">Even some Trump allies picture a dark future with Trump as their standard-bearer.<strong> </strong>Mike Detmer, a Trump-endorsed state Senate candidate in Michigan who lost his primary, said he is pessimistic Republicans will have any shot at picking up wins in his state after three election cycles that ended in defeat.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see Michigan flip red for a long, long time,\u201d Detmer said, predicting an exodus of Republicans from the state. \u201cIn fact, I think Michigan politically is going to be a blue state for the foreseeable future.\u201d He added, to put a finer point on it: \u201cI do not think Michigan is going to be in play for Trump in 2024.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Paul Cordes, the chief of staff at the Michigan GOP, expressed similar concerns last week in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TudorDixon/status/1590850114729693186?s=20&amp;t=bHBpbkgsQY09noCfrkD-_Q\">post-election memo</a>. Whitmer, thanks in part to Trump\u2019s public hazing of her, gained a national profile that made her a prime GOP target. Even without the Governor\u2019s Mansion, Republicans wielded considerable power while controlling the Legislature. But last week, voters shut them out of power in all three branches of government.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cOver the course of this cycle, the Michigan Republican Party operated within the political reality that President Trump was popular amongst our grassroots and a motivating factor for his supporters, but provided challenges on a statewide ballot, especially with independents and women in a midterm election,\u201d\u00a0Cordes wrote, referring to Tudor Dixon, a former conservative commentator who lost to Whitmer by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/michigan-governor-results\" target=\"_blank\">double digits</a>, and right-wing candidates for attorney general and secretary of state.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAs a Party, we found ourselves consistently navigating the power struggle between Trump and anti-Trump factions of the Party, mostly within the donor class,\u201d Cordes added. \u201cThat power struggle ended with too many people on the sidelines and hurt Republicans in key races.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Another veteran of GOP campaigns in Michigan worried that state party officials, including Co-Chair Meshawn Maddock, weren\u2019t taking the losses seriously enough.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cSince Trump was elected, we lost the state Supreme Court, lost the entire executive branch and the entire legislative branch,\u201d said the source, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about internal political dynamics. \u201cMeshawn Maddock was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoChairMeshawn/status/1590499048863444993\">on Twitter</a> last night bragging about winning school board elections. Like, dude, none of that matters.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Maddock, a Trump ally who didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, was a common denominator in assessments of the GOP fallout in Michigan.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt felt like the Republican Party here, with Meshawn Maddock taking over as the party co-chair, went full Trump and full culture war, and they started losing in places like where I represent,\u201d said state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a Democrat who <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/oakland-county-legislature-race-results-winners/1825027002/\">flipped</a> a Republican seat in 2018.</p> <p class=\"\">In Pennsylvania, GOP leaders had hoped to at least hold on to the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Pat Toomey. Trump threw himself into the primaries, endorsing far-right state Sen. Doug Mastriano for governor and Mehmet Oz, a celebrity doctor, for Senate. He rallied for both three days before the general election in Westmoreland County, a crucial red bastion outside Pittsburgh. But Mastriano was crushed in a landslide by Democrat Josh Shapiro, the state\u2019s attorney general, while Oz lost a closer race against Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. Both underperformed Trump\u2019s 2020 numbers in Westmoreland County.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWith regards to the governor\u2019s office, there\u2019s no way in a red year a candidate should lose by double digits,\u201d said David La Torre, a GOP consultant in Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd that really speaks to how poor our candidates were and how much Trump interfered in our primary process.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Morgan Boyd, a Republican member of the Lawrence County Commission in western Pennsylvania, called the election the \u201cbeginning of the end of the age of Trump.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019re seeing Trump\u2019s influence on the Republican Party weaken,\u201d said Boyd, who backed Shapiro in the governor\u2019s race and Oz in the Senate race. \u201cIt\u2019s time for him to pass the torch to more mainstream, traditional Republican candidates.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The worries about Trump extend beyond Pennsylvania and the industrial Midwest, into other battlegrounds, including Nevada, one of the first states on the 2024 primary calendar. Trump lost the state by narrow margins in 2016 and 2020. And although Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was re-elected last week, Republican Joe Lombardo unseated Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak \u2014 in one of the few bright spots for the GOP.</p> <p class=\"\">Amy Tarkanian, a former Nevada GOP chair, backed Trump in 2016 and 2020. Nonetheless, she called on the former president to clear the path for a new wave of leaders.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cPeople are ready for a statesman, someone who has the policies that he implemented but with a much different tone and demeanor,\u201d said Tarkanian, who warned that a Trump 2024 announcement this week would distract from next month\u2019s Senate runoff in Georgia, where Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and GOP rival Herschel Walker must face off again after both finished below the required 50% threshold in last week\u2019s general election.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cIf it\u2019s not all hands on deck for Herschel Walker and the conversation changes to Donald Trump,\u201d Tarkanian said, \u201cwe\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p>"},

Scott, who has barely concealed his larger ambitions, has sought to align himself more with the Trump wing of the party.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump recruited Walker to run, and McConnell allies and establishment Republican figures initially resisted the pick, worried that the former football star hadn't been vetted and that questions about his personal and professional life would trigger a brutal Democratic counterattack. But McConnell endorsed Walker in the primary, after which Democrats unloaded on the Republican nominee in <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/georgia-democrats-signal-brutal-ad-campaign-herschel-walker-senate-rac-rcna30309\" target=\"_blank\">a brutal ad campaign</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">The Dec. 6 Georgia runoff between Walker and Warnock won\u2019t decide the balance of power in the Senate, now that Democrats are assured control. But there is still a lot at stake for both parties. A win by Democrats would give them more procedural power, while a Republican victory would put the party in a stronger position to take control of the chamber in 2024.</p> <p class=\"\">On Tuesday, the sniping intensified when the CEO of McConnell\u2019s committee, Steven Law, highlighted a tweet that suggested the NRSC was scamming donors by soliciting email contributions on Walker\u2019s behalf but steering only 10% of the proceeds to the candidate, which his campaign <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/walker-calls-gop-deceptive-fundraising-georgia-race-rcna57136\">has asked other Republicans to refrain from doing</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cGood committees raise enough so that they don\u2019t have to steal from their candidates,\u201d Law <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LawAmericanX/status/1592589007372046336\">wrote</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisHartline/status/1592592993349173248\">NRSC fired back</a>, pointing out that the organization has pledged to spend all it can on Walker. And Walker\u2019s campaign agreed with that assessment, according to a source with the Senate campaign who didn\u2019t want to speak on the record and take sides in the feud.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe just want everyone to support Herschel so we can win,\u201d the source said.</p> <p class=\"\">The squabbling comes as some Republicans are already worried about a repeat of the 2020 election, when party divisions contributed to the defeat of two GOP incumbents in a runoff in Georgia and delivered Senate control to Democrats by the slimmest of margins, empowering President Joe Biden.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s always a fear. It\u2019s happened to us already. Hopefully, we learned from it,\u201d Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., told NBC News. \u201cYou gotta have a game plan. I\u2019m a football coach.

That\u2019s a huge break from recent history where members have been pretty intimately involved.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">NRSC spokesman Chris Hartline responded Monday on Twitter to call Holmes\u2019 claim \u201cutter nonsense of course, evidenced by the fact that there are zero GOP senators quoted in the story echoing this claim.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Tensions between the two Senate sides have been noticeably brewing since Scott took over the reins of the NRSC after the 2020 elections. At the time, Scott bucked McConnell by voting against certifying the 2020 election results after a pro-Trump mob sacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p> <p class=\"\">The riot came a day after Republicans lost control of the Senate thanks to a rare double-header special election runoff when both GOP incumbents were defeated by their Democratic challengers, one of whom was Warnock. Many Republicans, especially those in McConnell\u2019s orbit, blamed Trump and his lies about the 2020 elections for depressing Republican turnout and pushing college-educated voters into the arms of Democrats.</p> <p class=\"\">Scott and McConnell have had a strained relationship ever since.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump tried to recruit Senate candidates and senators to vote against McConnell as Republican leader.

And they want McCarthy to agree to a series of rules changes that would water down the power of the next speaker and give rank-and-file members more control.</p> <p class=\"\">Specifically, they want McCarthy to reinstate a rule to make it easier to force votes to oust a sitting speaker \u2014 something known as a \u201cmotion to vacate.\u201d McCarthy is unlikely to agree, but he could support other reforms, like requiring bills to go through committee before they are brought to the floor, allowing amendments on all bills that come to the floor and giving members more time to read bills before they are voted on.</p> <p class=\"\">One thing McCarthy has going for him is support from some influential figures in the Republican Party. Former President Donald Trump, who is expected to announce a 2024 presidential bid later Tuesday, has endorsed McCarthy, his longtime ally, for speaker. So has Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a Freedom Caucus member who is enormously popular among grassroots conservatives.</p> <p class=\"\">McCarthy also won backing from a onetime rival, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who challenged him for minority leader in 2018 and led the Freedom Caucus in 2015 when it derailed McCarthy's first unsuccessful bid for speaker.</p> <p class=\"\">Since then, McCarthy has wooed Jordan and other conservatives with plum assignments and other offerings. He helped Jordan win the top Republican spot on the powerful Judiciary Committee, which will set Jordan up to become chairman if Republicans take control of the House.</p> <p class=\"\">Jordan said in an interview Tuesday that he hoped his Freedom Caucus colleagues could work out a deal with McCarthy that would pave the way for his speakership.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\"I think they can hopefully put together an agreement and we get there,\" Jordan said. \"The key thing for Republicans is that we stay unified so we can stop the craziness from the Biden administration. That's what I'm focused on.\"</p>"},

In a Republican primary, my prediction is he will continue to play extremely heavily in an important role.\"</p> <p class=\"\">For Brown, this year\u2019s midterm elections in Ohio have yielded a more unpleasant set of questions than the last. After securing his third term in 2018, Brown <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/sherrod-brown-connie-schultz-2020-primary-ohio-president\" target=\"_blank\">flirted with a run for president</a>, holding up his victory as a blueprint for how Democrats could win back red-leaning Midwest states. This time, he finds himself shutting down speculation that he\u2019ll retire.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI run to win,\u201d he told reporters this week after confirming that he plans to run again in 2024. \u201cAnd people recognize that I get up every day and fight for the dignity of work.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Justin Barasky, who managed Brown\u2019s re-election campaign in 2018 and served as a media strategist for Ryan, emphasized several differences between the two Democrats \u2014 differences that he said show Brown is not as vulnerable as Republicans believe him to be.</p> <p class=\"\">For one, Barasky said, Brown won\u2019t be running in the midterm of an unpopular presidential administration, although Biden has said he plans to seek re-election in 2024. The ticket in Ohio won\u2019t be led by DeWine, who won last week by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/ohio-governor-results?icid=election_statenav\">roughly 25 points</a> and likely had coattails for Vance and other Republicans on the ballot. And national Democrats are far more likely to spend money on Brown, an incumbent they can\u2019t afford to lose, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/national-democrats-ignore-ohio-senate-race-leaving-tim-ryan-lonesome-rcna51435\" target=\"_blank\">than they were on Ryan</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWhile Tim Ryan I think did an excellent job of introducing himself and defining himself statewide, he still had to do it,\u201d Barasky said. \u201cSherrod already has a statewide brand.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Chabria agreed that Brown will be a tough opponent.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cHe is a different beast than Tim Ryan, because Tim Ryan was a Xerox of a Xerox of Sherrod Brown,\u201d Chabria said. \u201cSherrod Brown actually understands what it means to be a populist.\u201d</p>"},
{"title": "FBI, DHS and social media firms like Meta, TikTok aren't adequately addressing threat of domestic extremists, Senate report says", "content": "<p class=\"\">An investigation by the Senate Homeland Security Committee alleges that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and leading social media companies are not adequately addressing<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/there-no-law-covers-domestic-terrorism-what-would-one-look-n1040386\" target=\"_blank\"> the growing threat of domestic terrorism</a>, especially white supremacist and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/domestic-extremists-pushing-violence-against-congress-school-health-officials-dhs-n1283672\" target=\"_blank\">anti-government extremists</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">In a 128-page report obtained by NBC News, the committee\u2019s majority Democrats say federal law enforcement agencies have not appropriately allocated resources to match the metastasizing threat, and have failed to systematically track and report data on domestic terrorism incidents, as required by federal law.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cUnfortunately, our counterterrorism agencies have not effectively tracked the data that you need to measure this threat,\u201d Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said Wednesday. \u201cIf they\u2019re not tracking it, it\u2019s likely they are not prioritizing our counterterrorism resources to effectively counter this threat.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In a statement, the FBI said it is \u201cagile\u201d and adjusts resources to meet the latest threats, while DHS said that \"addressing domestic violent extremism is a top priority\" for the department. </p> <p class=\"\">A Meta spokesperson pointed to the company's most recent Community Standards Enforcement Report, which highlights what the spokesperson described as a low prevalence of terror and organized hate content on Facebook and Instagram.\u00a0A top executive, Nick Clegg, said last year, \u201c<a href=\"https://nickclegg.medium.com/you-and-the-algorithm-it-takes-two-to-tango-7722b19aa1c2\" target=\"_blank\">The reality is</a>, it\u2019s not in Facebook\u2019s interest \u2014 financially or reputationally \u2014 to continually turn up the temperature and push users towards ever more extreme content.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement,\u00a0\u201cWe believe that maintaining a safe and trusted platform is critical to our long-term success, which is why we are dedicated to identifying and removing content that incites or glorifies violence or promotes violent extremist organizations.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">A YouTube spokeswoman said the platform is acting to block extremist content. Twitter did not immediately provide comment in response to a request.</p> <p class=\"\">The report found that the FBI and DHS continue to spend more on international terrorism, despite saying for years that domestic terrorism now poses a greater threat to Americans.</p> <p class=\"\">The investigation also found that social media companies \u201chave failed to meaningfully address the growing presence of extremism on their platforms,\u201d and that the business models of four leading social media outlets \u2014 Meta, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube \u2014 are based on maximizing user engagement, growth, and profits, which incentivizes increasingly extreme content.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThese companies point to the voluminous amount of violative content they remove from their platforms, but the investigation found that their own recommendations algorithms and other features and products play in the proliferation of that content in the first place,\u201d the report said. \u201cAbsent new incentives or regulation, extremist content will continue to proliferate on these platforms and companies\u2019 content moderation efforts will continue to be inadequate to stop its spread.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The report\u2019s analysis of the FBI and DHS response to domestic terrorism appears to have been hampered by a lack of data. For example, the committee said neither agency provided complete information on how many employees and how much money were devoted to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/white-house-unveils-new-strategy-counter-domestic-terrorism-laser-focused-n1270819\" target=\"_blank\">combating domestic terrorism</a>, despite a 2020 law requiring them to do so.</p> <p class=\"\">Although experts say the threat from domestic violent extremists has been building for years, the committee found that arrests and federal charges in domestic terrorism cases involving the FBI had been steadily declining before <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jan-6-committee-staffers-told-preliminary-plan-final-report-focus-larg-rcna56802\" target=\"_blank\">the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol</a>. Arrests and charges in domestic extremism cases have since spiked, but the bulk of them are related to the Capitol riot investigation.</p> <p class=\"\">The report suggests that despite prioritizing domestic violent extremism in recent years, the FBI appears quicker to call an attack terrorism when it was carried out in the name of jihadist ideology than white supremacist beliefs.</p> <p class=\"\">Both DHS and FBI define \u201chomegrown violent extremists\u201d as terrorists inspired by foreign ideologies. The report points out that the people accused of killing 23 people in El Paso, Texas, and 10 people in Buffalo, New York, were not given that designation though they reportedly claimed inspiration from the international terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, among other racist and antisemitic ideologies.</p> <p class=\"\">At the same time, the FBI categorized a Muslim man who killed U.S. military personnel in a July 2015 mass shooting that killed four U.S. Marines and a Navy sailor in Tennessee as a homegrown violent extremist, \u201cdespite not having information on which international terrorist organization supposedly inspired the attack,\u201d the report said.</p> <p class=\"\">The report said a change in how the FBI categorizes domestic terrorism ideologies has been a hindrance to understanding the problem. In 2017, FBI created a new category of domestic terrorism ideology called \u201cBlack Identity Extremists,\u201d but then stopped using it. By 2019, the FBI combined all forms of racially motivated extremism, including the pre-existing category of \u201cWhite Supremacist Violence,\u201d into one category called \u201cRacially Motivated Violent Extremists.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThis change obscures the full scope of white supremacist terrorist attacks, and it has prevented the federal government from accurately measuring domestic terrorism threats,\u201d the report said.</p> <p class=\"\">The report also criticized the FBI and DHS as having been conservative in hunting for threat intelligence posted publicly on social media. The FBI has said that a torrent of threat information leading up to the Jan. 6 attack was not specific enough to have prompted action.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAgencies have been slow to adapt to the open planning of extremist violence online, leading to incomplete threat assessments,\u201d the report said.</p> <p class=\"\">Peters added in a phone call with reporters: \u201cThe FBI and DHS must do a better job\u201d monitoring threat information on social media. Before the Jan. 6 attack, he said, \u201cThere was a lot of open-source material that was out there indicating that people were planning to come to the Capitol and engage in violent acts. \u2026 These agencies have to be quicker on their feet.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The report said the FBI uses a company called ZeroFox that identifies potentially concerning posts from social media platforms based on specific search terms identified and approved by the bureau. After identifying these posts, ZeroFox generates automatic alerts for FBI to investigate further. Each field office decides whether and how to use the data, the report said, and as a result, the data is not used consistently by FBI agents across the country.</p> <p class=\"\">DHS, meanwhile, \u201chas failed to effectively utilize\u201d its legal authority to monitor public social media. The report noted that the DHS inspector general found that DHS\u2019s intelligence office \u201cidentified specific threat information related to the events on January 6, 2021, but did not issue any intelligence products about these threats until January 8, 2021,\u201d despite communicating internally about security concerns.</p> <p class=\"\">In a statement, DHS said it \u201cengages in a community-based approach to prevent terrorism and targeted violence, and does so in ways that protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties, and that adhere to all applicable laws. To that end, DHS regularly shares information regarding the heightened threat environment with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial officials to ensure the safety and security of all communities across the country.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The report is unsparing in its criticism of major social media platforms, which it says are a hotbed of extremist content.</p> <p class=\"\">It cited a study by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, which found that in 2016, use of social media played a role in the radicalization processes of nearly 90% of U.S. extremist plots and activities. The study found that social media \u201chas become an increasingly important tool for extremists to disseminate content, share ideas, and facilitate relationships.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The committee requested information from Meta, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube, which it said have a combined footprint that reaches nearly 75% of Americans and several billion people worldwide.</p> <p class=\"\">The bottom line, the report found: \u201cAlthough Meta, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube have a range of policies aimed at addressing extremist and hateful content on their platforms \u2026 extreme content is still prevalent across these platforms.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The report added:</p> <p class=\"\">YouTube spokeswoman Ivy Choi said in an email: \u201cResponsibility is our top priority and informs every product and policy decision we make. We have established policies against hate speech, harmful conspiracies and violent extremism, and in Q2 2022, only 9 to 11 views out of every 10,000 came from violative content. Additionally, our recommendation system surfaces authoritative content in search results and the Watch Next panel, including for search queries related to violent extremism. While study in this area continues, a number of researchers have found that our recommendations aren\u2019t steering viewers towards extreme content.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The report\u2019s policy recommendation to address these issues is vague.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cCongress and regulators should create accountability mechanisms for social media companies to prioritize safety in the development of their products and features,\u201d the report said, adding that lawmakers should \u201cconsider removing current protections in law that allow companies, without meaningful consequences, to continue to prioritize engagement on their platforms even if that results in knowingly promoting extreme content.\u201d</p>"},

All 14 races where election deniers won were in states that voted to elect Trump in both 2016 and 2020. </p> <p class=\"\">Still, that represents 14 too many for some.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cElection denialism is still alive and well,\u201d said Trey Grayson, a former Republican secretary of state in Kentucky. \u201cAbout 31% of the population of the country, living in [these] states will still have an election denier as their governor, their attorney general or their secretary of state, all of whom still have power in some shape or form over their elections.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cJust one election denier in any state is too many, because it means there are Americans who are under the threat of having their voice not count in the next election,\u201d added Grayson, who also pointed to victorious Republican congressional candidates who denied or questioned the results of the 2020 election \u2014 a group that includes <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/ohio-senate-midterm-2022-jd-vance-wins-rcna55175\">J.D.

Changes to those processes could affect the election in 2024, when Trump has announced he will run. For example, many secretaries of state oversee the offices that administer all elections. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/election-deniers-say-trump-won-2020-are-running-top-cop-4-battleground-rcna29705\">State attorneys generals</a> can launch or defend against election lawsuits that can ultimately affect the vote-counting process.

Williams traveled to D.C. with her dad but was separated from him before she entered the Capitol.</p> <p class=\"\">But the two sides differed in what her actions meant.

Advocates say it also would\u2019ve required school staff to out students questioning their gender identity to their parents.</p> <p class=\"\">After testimony from Schneider and a few others, the Families, Aging, and Human Services Committee <a href=\"https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/download?key=19714&amp;format=pdf\" target=\"_blank\">adopted a substitute bill</a> that Rep. Gary Click, a Republican and one of the original bill's sponsors, said was an effort to listen to the concerns of critics. </p> <p class=\"\">The substitute bill would prohibit physicians from performing gender-affirming surgery on minors and from referring a minor to a mental health professional \u201cfor the diagnosis or treatment of a gender-related condition\u201d without first disclosing the referral to the minor\u2019s parent or guardian. It would also permit a physician to prescribe puberty blockers or hormone therapy if a list of conditions are met. Among them, the physician must confirm the minor has previously received routine counseling for two years related to their transition, and the use of the medications cannot \u201cresult in an increased risk of vaginal atrophy, penile atrophy, testicular atrophy, permanent loss of libido, sterility, endometrial carcinoma, or polycystic ovary syndrome.\u201d </p> <p class=\"\">The substitute also requires physicians who prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapy to annually report data related to these treatments to the Ohio Department of Health, including the number of patients receiving such care, as well as their ages and sex assigned at birth. </p> <p class=\"\">During Wednesday's hearing, Click said the reporting requirements are an effort to gather more data on transgender people and their medical treatments in Ohio. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ve made quite a few concessions, and that\u2019s to bring this to a middle ground,\u201d Click said of the substitute bill. \u201cOur goal is to ensure safety for those who transition and that only the people who are ready for transition transition.\u201d </p> <p class=\"\">Many of those who testified Wednesday<strong> </strong>after the substitute bill was adopted said the updated proposal introduced by Click would still negatively impact trans youth in the state by creating unnecessary barriers to the care. Click did not immediately return a request for additional comment.</p> <p class=\"\">Nick Lashutka, president and CEO of the Ohio Children's Hospital Association, said that imposing a two-year waiting period for the use of medication \"would create an environment where it would not be used at all.\"</p> <p class=\"\">He also said delaying treatment for two years would cause trans youth diagnosed with gender dysphoria to experience more depression, which would create another hurdle for them to begin treatment, because the substitute bill requires other comorbidities to be treated for two years before treatment.</p> <p class=\"\">Accredited medical organizations \u2014 including the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-states-stop-interfering-health-care-transgender-children\">American Medical Association</a>, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/03/09/transgender-legislation-030921\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-supporting-gender-diverse-children.pdf\">American Psychological Association</a>\u00a0\u2014 have supported gender-affirming care for minors.</p> <p class=\"\">Some Ohio families said the bill would force them to move.</p> <p class=\"\">Gary Greenberg, who described himself as a retired educator, said one of his six grandchildren is seeing a therapist for treatment of gender dysphoria. As a result, if the bill becomes law, his daughter said she will have to leave the state, and she told Greenberg that she would take him with them.</p> <p class=\"\">\"So here we have proposed law in Ohio that would cause three generations \u2014 three \u2014 of an Ohio family to flee the state, and we will be the lucky ones,\" he said, because they have the resources to leave when many others don't. </p> <p class=\"\">Schneider did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment about the amended bill. </p> <p class=\"\">Ohio is part of a wave of states that have considered bills to restrict gender-affirming medical care for minors over the last two years.

Republicans had hopes of sweeping into power with dozens of wins, but instead they will have only a thin majority, complicating their ability to function in the House chamber. </p> <p class=\"\">The results revealed an America still torn over former President Donald Trump, his repeated false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him and how the country and the GOP should move forward. In several close races, voters cited the economy and inflation as their top concerns, but they weren't enough to power Republicans to a decisive sweep after Trump effectively made the elections a referendum on him, his past and his plans as the de facto leader of the party.</p> <p class=\"\">The results came down to a handful of tight races.

He won re-election to remain the top Republican in the Senate, a post he has held since 2007. </p> <p class=\"\">Biden will be forced to negotiate with whoever comes out on top in the Republican leadership fight, teeing up battles over aid to Ukraine and keeping the government funded as Republicans try to drag him down ahead of the 2024 presidential election.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI congratulate Leader McCarthy on Republicans winning the House majority, and am ready to work with House Republicans to deliver results for working families,\" the president said in a statement Wednesday evening.</p> <p class=\"\">But the modest size of the new Republican majority, which fell well short of bullish predictions, means party leaders will be hemmed in by the need to secure near-unanimous support from their caucus, unable to afford more than a few defections. </p> <p class=\"endmark\">It\u2019s a dynamic similar to the one that defined most of President Barack Obama\u2019s time in the White House, when Biden was vice president. Like Biden, Obama entered the presidency with Democrats in full control of Congress, until Republicans won the House in his first midterms as Democrats held the Senate.\u00a0</p>"},

He said <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/crypto-billionaire-says-spend-record-breaking-1-billion-2024-election-rcna30351\">$1 billion</a> would be a \u201csoft ceiling\u201d for his spending in 2024.</p> <p class=\"\">Then, all of a sudden \u2014 on Election Day, ironically \u2014 the gravy train crashed.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">FTX, the Bahamas-based crypto currency exchange that Bankman-Fried founded, abruptly collapsed into bankruptcy, federal investigations and accusations of fraud. Millions of small-time FTX users may be wiped out. And the people who thought he was the next big thing in Washington are still trying to figure out what happened.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI was very concerned that Sam was so young and had so much power and could have a massive impact on so many millions of peoples\u2019 lives without understanding what he was doing,\u201d said Leah Hunt-Hendrix, a Democratic donor and activist who founded the donor network Way to Win. \u201cI was worried that would happen politically. It didn\u2019t happen that way, but it did happen.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">His downfall will leave some Democratic groups with <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/sam-bankman-frieds-downfall-deprives-dems-key-donor-rcna57091\">budget holes to fill</a>.

Everybody was trying to get in,\u201d said one source close to the Bankman-Frieds\u2019 political operation who requested anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cThis went from the hottest thing to the most toxic thing. But that\u2019s how D.C. works.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The high-priced consultants and lobbyists the Bankman-Frieds employed will be fine, said the source. \u201cThe person who got most f----- from all this is probably his brother,\u201d the source continued, \u201cSomebody who probably had no idea what was going on on the business side,<strong> </strong>who unfortunately shares the same hyphenated name, who has worked in politics and is now probably not going to be able to.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Gabe Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://puck.news/inside-the-s-b-f-blast-radius/\" target=\"_blank\">resigned Monday</a> from Guarding Against Pandemics, the nonprofit that purchased the Capitol Hill townhouse and served as the hub for its philanthropic work, telling his roughly three-dozen employees he didn\u2019t want to get in the way of the group\u2019s mission as it scrambles to find new funders.</p> <p class=\"\">Neither Gabe Bankman-Fried nor Guarding Against Pandemics responded to a request for comment. Attempts to contact Sam Bankman-Fried for this article were unsuccessful. </p> <p class=\"\">Their mother, Stanford Law professor Barbara Fried, stepped down from the Silicon Valley donor circle she founded before Sam got wealthy.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The whole Bankman-Fried family is associated with Effective Altruism, a buzzy philosophical movement popular in Silicon Valley that Barbara helped pioneer and Sam helped fund, which is now facing its own philosophical crisis as some argue their \u201cearn to give\u201d model is inherently compromised.</p> <p class=\"\">Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s mentor and the spiritual leader of Effective Altruism has disowned him. \u201cI had put my trust in Sam, and if he lied and misused customer funds he betrayed me, just as he betrayed his customers, his employees, his investors, &amp; the communities he was a part of,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1591218014707671040\">tweeted</a> Oxford professor Will MacAskill, who resigned as an adviser to FTX\u2019s philanthropic arm.</p> <p class=\"\">But critics say Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s collapse shows that the movement was always morally compromised \u2014 \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnandWrites/status/1592166154163949570\">a con</a>,\u201d as author Anand Giridharadas put it \u2014 because it didn\u2019t seem to care how people made their money, as long as they spent it.</p> <p class=\"\">The vision was compelling, even to hard-bitten political operatives and reporters.</p> <p class=\"\">Sam Bankman-Fried, whose personal net wealth was once valued at $24 billion and with decades of earning potential ahead of him, planned to join \u2014 or even surpass \u2014 the tiny handful of top-tier political donors who use their vast resources to not just fund candidates, but to build entire generation-defining movements and the research, infrastructure and communications capacities that go into them.</p> <p class=\"\">They were going to go \u201czero to Bloomberg in 60 weeks,\u201d as another source who works in politics and is familiar with Bankman-Fried\u2019s organization put it, referring to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has pumped millions of his own dollars into helping elect Democrats and has built a large operation to lobby for policy changes, including gun control. The source added that the comparison would also work with the conservative brothers Charles and David Koch, who not only invested millions into electing Republicans but also built a vast libertarian-leaning policy and field organizing effort.</p> <p class=\"\">Many doubted the sincerity of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s philanthropic efforts, however, since he was simultaneously bankrolling a massive Washington operation to shape federal regulation of the crypto industry. But he is hardly the first wealthy donor, and certainly won't be the last, whose ideological agenda is difficult to disengage from business motives.</p> <p class=\"\">The Bankman-Frieds entered the political scene aggressively, \u201cjust coming into these primaries and swinging their money around and buying these people off. It was just wild,\u201d said a progressive activist who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the donors.</p> <p class=\"\">And with his performatively disheveled curly hair and ill-fitting suits, the young billionaire was a fascinating character, especially for his fellow millennial political and media types who <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/millennials-forged-recession-ridicule-are-ascendant-washington-n1262002\">increasingly run</a> Washington.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI happen to be a big skeptic of the cryptocurrency craze, but was intrigued by this 30-year-old who had supposedly amassed a $30 billion fortune and then became an influential political donor,\u201d said Jamie Weinstein, a journalist who invited Bankman-Fried to one of the exclusive off-the-record dinners he hosts with reporters and influential political figures. \u201cFor what it's worth, I\u2019d still be willing to host Sam for dinner \u2014 it would probably be more interesting now! \u2014but I suspect the next time he comes to the states it will be in handcuffs.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">While Sam handled the \u201cearning\u201d from FTX\u2019s headquarters in the Bahamas, Gabe represented the \u201cgive\u201d side.</p> <p class=\"\">At just 27 and still living with roommates in a rented Northwest Washington home, he quickly had become a darling of young progressive circles in Washington, where he could be spotted holding court with political aspirants interested in his largesse. \u201cI spend a lot of my day talking to candidates for office,\u201d he told NBC News in May.</p> <p class=\"\">Spending lavishly on candidates and their staffers to get their attention, Gabe Bankman-Fried argued their aim was to tackle existential threats to humanity, like pandemic prevention and nuclear nonproliferation, which were seen as neglected by existing institutions funded by earlier generations of now-controversial capitalists, like Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford.</p> <p class=\"\">But they didn\u2019t see the existential threat to themselves.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThey were certainly building an organization for the long-term. Then the music stopped,\u201d said another source familiar with the organization who requested anonymity to speak candidly.</p> <p class=\"\">Sam Bankman-Fried and his fellow FTX executives followed the well-established lobbying playbook of spreading money around Washington \u2014 at least $70 million on 2022 campaigns, with three sources saying there was much more in \u201cdark money\u201d \u2014 to make friends with whoever ended up in power, regardless of the outcome of the elections.</p> <p class=\"\">Sam Bankman-Fried is a Democrat, and he spent at least $40 million supporting the party. But he also gave $45,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee, and more than $100,000 each to two groups supporting Republican Senate candidates in deep red states, while entities he funded gave even more.</p> <p class=\"\">Other FTX executives, like co-CEO Ryan Salame, gave more than $15 million this year, mostly to Republicans.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The people spending Bankman-Fried\u2019s money also made sure to support candidates and causes in both wings of both parties, for instance, retaining progressives like Data for Progress founder Sean McElwee while joining with groups like AIPAC to support moderates as they pummeled progressives with hard-hitting TV ads in Democratic primaries.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThere were parts of the Democratic Party that were willing to swallow the crypto industry when it was really like making nice with the subprime mortgage lenders in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d said Max Berger, a former aide to Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign, referring to another industry that <a href=\"https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mst2_0.pdf\">spent heavily in politics</a> before it crashed the global economy. \u201cThey knew that their real friends were Republicans, but they needed enough Democratic support to give the patina of bipartisanship. They talked a good game and found people willing to play along.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">When FTX collapsed, people of all political stripes in Washington were left contaminated by its now-toxic money, helping to explain why there have been relatively few calls to return it.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of reasons that some folks on the left have been less vocal on crypto than they might have been, but I do think the effort to buy off key progressive voices and thought leaders has played a role,\u201d Berger added.</p> <p class=\"\">Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, is one of the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/15/lawmakers-return-ftx-money-00067009\">few recipients</a> of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s money who has said he plans to give the equivalent $2,900 to charity, a spokesperson told NBC News.</p> <p class=\"\">Some of the biggest recipients of Bankman-Fried\u2019s money did not respond to NBC News when asked about donations they received. Those include: House Majority PAC, which took $6 million; Senate Majority PAC, which took $1 million; the Democratic National Committee, which took over $900,000; the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which took $250,000; and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which took over $66,000.</p> <p class=\"\">That represents a drop in the bucket of what Bankman-Fried looked poised to spend over his lifetime.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">In a podcast interview in May, he said he would spend \u201cnorth of $100 million\u201d in the next presidential election.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cAs for how much more than that, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really does depend on what happens.\u201d</p>"},

Raphael Warnock in next month\u2019s runoff election expected to encounter an exhausted electorate as voters prepare to head to the polls for the second time in as many months. They underscore the importance of educating Black voters about the significance of the Dec. 6 runoff between Warnock and Republican contender Herschel Walker.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Yet <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/warnock-campaign-lays-strategy-georgia-senate-runoff-calling-walker-co-rcna56592\">voting rights organizations supporting Warnock</a> say Black voters they\u2019ve spoken with remain energized because expanding Democrats\u2019 majority in the Senate even by a single seat would have a significant impact. It would allow the party to combat occasional outliers like Sen. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat with a <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/M001183/votes-against-party/116\">history of voting against his party</a>.\u201cIt is critical we get the largest margin possible, and 51 is determinatively better than 50,\u201d said Rahna Epting, the executive director of <a href=\"https://front.moveon.org/\">MoveOn</a>, a progressive grassroots organization. \u201cIt means Republicans can\u2019t block as much of our agenda as they could otherwise.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In last week\u2019s election, Warnock got 90% of the Black vote, compared with Walker\u2019s 8%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/georgia-senate-results?icid=election_usmap\">NBC News Exit Poll</a>. In the 2020 general election against Kelly Loeffler, the white Republican incumbent, Warnock got 92% of the Black <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/nbc-news-exit-poll-georgia-runoff-voters-split-party-whether-n1252851\">vote</a> and 93% in the subsequent <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-special-elections/georgia-senate-runoff-results\">runoff</a>, NBC News exit polls said. The show of Black support for Warnock in this year\u2019s\u00a0midterms, combined with African Americans\u2019 role in turning the traditionally red state blue in 2020, has helped\u00a0keep many Democratic Black voters engaged in the contest.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Epting\u2019s group began working the day after the runoff was declared, \u201cmoving on all cylinders,\u201d she said, to encourage Black voters to come out to support Warnock next month. That meant calling voters to remind them of the urgency of the runoff, a consistent email campaign with a similar message and door-to-door canvassing.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe have to let people know we\u2019re in a runoff and what\u2019s at stake between electing Warnock or Walker,\u201d Epting said. \u201cIf we do our job to educate folks about what\u2019s at stake, that there is a runoff election and this is the day by which you need to vote and here\u2019s how you do it \u2026 I think we can win.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u00a0Lloyd Ramsey, an Atlanta voter who works in retail sales, agreed, saying voters \u201cmight be tired of having to go to the polls\u201d but \u201caren\u2019t too tired.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cNo doubt, we know we can influence elections here in Georgia, which was something we couldn\u2019t say before 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted this power or whatever you want to call it. Now that we have it, we won\u2019t misuse it by not voting in the runoff. That\u2019s not happening \u2014 tired or not.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Warnock is counting on Black people to flood the polls as they did in <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/01/02/black-americans-power-2020-453345\">2020</a> and 2021,\u00a0when their record turnout was decisive for Joe Biden to win the presidency and Warnock and Jon Ossoff to win Senate seats.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m concerned that people are tired, but I\u2019m not convinced that will translate into lower voter turnout of Black people,\u201d Epting said. \u201cWe have long been tired in this country from the problems and how we\u2019ve been marginalized and how we\u2019ve been treated. I think voter fatigue is real, but I think it\u2019s fatigue across the globe around the challenges that we are all facing at this point. \u2026 But Black people have shown up for democracy for generations, and I believe that we will show up again in Georgia.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">To ensure they will, grassroots organizations like Black Voters Matter have continued their work, attacking the runoff full bore.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThey say that the average voter needs to get at least five contacts in order to be reminded to go vote,\u201d said Cliff Albright, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter. \u201cSo we\u2019re doing text messages. We\u2019re doing social media messaging. We\u2019re doing radio ads. We\u2019re doing door to door. We\u2019re doing phone calls. We\u2019re doing digital advertising on streaming services. \u2026 You name the kind of outreach, and we\u2019re doing it.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Georgia native Hillary Holley, the executive director of <a href=\"https://careinaction.us/\">Care in Action</a>, another voting and advocacy group, said she has felt a surge of energy from Black voters over the last two years.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThis is a story of resiliency,\u201d Holley said. \u201cMy family and friends, they\u2019ll say: \u2018Oh my gosh. We have to vote again?\u2019 But then they\u2019re like: \u2018OK. All right. When is it? What do I need to do?\u2019 We are pivoting again, and people are ready.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">She said her organization was ready for a runoff before the general election. \u201cWe know that we live in Jim Crow still,\u201d Holley said. \u201cWe started planning for the runoff weeks ago. And those plans are in motion. They\u2019re literally knocking on doors.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">While advocacy groups in support of Warnock are finding ways to keep the Black voter momentum going ahead of the runoff, Walker\u2019s team is also strategizing, hoping for more campaign funds from the GOP. NBC News reported this week that <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/walker-calls-gop-deceptive-fundraising-georgia-race-rcna57136\">Walker\u2019s campaign had taken note of fundraising by other Republicans</a>, including former President Donald Trump\u2019s Save America PAC, off his runoff but giving Walker only a small part of the proceeds.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe need everyone focused on winning the Georgia Senate race, and deceptive fundraising tactics by teams that just won their races are siphoning money away from Georgia,\u201d Walker campaign manager Scott Paradise said. \u201cThis is the last fight of 2022, and every dollar will help.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Fundraising efforts and getting out the vote are major priorities for both candidates, but Holley, like other leaders of advocacy groups looking to rally Black voters, said there is also a need to counter voter suppression. Some insist that there are elements of it in a bill called <a href=\"https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/03/27/what-does-georgias-new-voting-law-sb-202-do\">SB 202</a>, also known as the Election Integrity Act of 2021, which was passed last year in Georgia. The new <a href=\"https://fairfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TOP-50-Reasons-Why-SB202-Is-Harmful-to-Voters.pdf\">voter guidelines</a> mandate a\u00a0four-week turnaround for runoffs, only one week of early voting and no opportunity to register and cast ballots before runoffs. To that end, Warnock\u2019s campaign is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/15/raphael-warnock-sues-georgia-early-voting-restrictions\">suing</a> the state because the new restrictions allow for only one Saturday to vote before Dec. 6.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAll the elements we\u2019re talking about impact mostly Black voters,\u201d Albright said. \u201cThey carved out this voter suppression bill in Georgia with surgical precision. Black and brown people disproportionately vote more on the weekends and early. This is all a response to the massive turnout we saw in the runoff in 2020 after eight weeks. But it\u2019s also why what we do is so important.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Albright said what he sees as voter suppression attempts have been vast but unsuccessful, as evidenced by the general election turnout. Instead, he believes the attempts \u201ccould be galvanizing Black voters.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cPeople like to say: \u2018Oh, you had such a big turnout in Georgia. I guess there wasn\u2019t voter suppression,\u2019\u201d Albright said. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what it means. It just means that we\u2019ve been able to organize and that Black voters have responded in a way where we\u2019re resolute about not being blocked from voting. And tired or not, Black voters will come out for the runoff.\u201d</p> <p class=\"endmark\"><strong><em>Follow\u00a0</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbcblk\"><strong><em>NBCBLK</em></strong></a><strong><em>\u00a0on\u00a0</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nbcblk/\"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><strong><em>,\u00a0</em></strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbcblk\"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a><strong><em>\u00a0and\u00a0</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nbcblk\"><strong><em>Instagram</em></strong></a><strong><em>. </em></strong></p>"},

This is not Ukraine\u2019s fault,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters at the alliance\u2019s headquarters in Brussels. Citing Ukraine\u2019s need for self-defense, he added. \u201cRussia bears ultimate responsibility.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The White House quickly agreed, saying the U.S. had \u201cseen nothing that contradicts\u201d Poland\u2019s assessment that it was most likely a Ukrainian air defense missile that landed in its territory. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. was \u201cstill gathering information\u201d but concurred about the missile\u2019s likely Ukrainian origins.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe have full confidence in the Polish government investigation of this explosion,\u201d he said. And at the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield sought to delicately refocus the conversation, telling the Security Council: \u201cThis tragedy would never have happened but for Russia\u2019s needless invasion of Ukraine.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Evelyn Farkas, a former top Pentagon official for Russia, told NBC News that she worried the public disagreement was a distraction at a key moment when the focus should be on rallying behind Ukraine and deterring Moscow from infringing on any NATO territory.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAny kind of disputes we have about what happened should be discussed behind closed doors,\u201d said Farkas, the executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership. \u201cArguing about what missile it was publicly only serves to help Russia and makes it look like we lack political cohesiveness and the will to stand up to Russia.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Throughout the war, Russia has tried to stoke divisions between Ukraine and its allies, hoping to dent Western support that has proven critical to Kyiv\u2019s unlikely battlefield success.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Ukraine\u2019s supporters have also accused Russia of trying to drive up energy and other costs for European nations that rely on Russian supplies, in hopes of spurring public fatigue over the war and diminishing political support for sanctions on Russia and continued military assistance to Ukraine.</p> <p class=\"\">Although U.S. officials took pains to downplay any disagreement, there were clear signs that Ukraine was bristling at its allies\u2019 public stance.\u00a0The tension comes as Kyiv has also pushed back against suggestions from Washington that now might be a good time to consider sitting down to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p> <p class=\"\">Moscow has sought to exploit the divisions between Ukraine and its supporters.</p> <p class=\"\">In the fog of war, many Western officials initially had speculated Tuesday that the missile may have been launched by Russia, an assumption Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov decried as \u201canother hysterical, rabid Russophobic reaction, which was not based on any real data.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">As U.S., Polish and other intelligence and military officials began investigating, the Biden administration said little publicly, deferring initially to Polish President Andrzej Duda. He ultimately said that what had struck his country was most likely a \u201cRussian-made\u201d S-300, a Soviet-era surface-to-air missile that both Russia and Ukraine possess.</p> <p class=\"\">By Wednesday morning, when Biden issued his first public comments after meeting urgently on the matter with Group of Seven and NATO leaders, he said it was \u201cunlikely, in the minds of the trajectory, that it was fired from Russia,\u201d prompting rare praise from the Kremlin.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt is worth paying attention to the restrained and much more professional reaction of the American side and the American president,\u201d Peskov said.</p> <p class=\"\">And despite Poland\u2019s acknowledgment Wednesday that the missile was likely Ukrainian, Russia summoned the Polish ambassador to Moscow to the Foreign Ministry to be dressed down, presumably because Poland hadn\u2019t pointed the finger at Ukraine sooner.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cYou were one step away from catastrophe only because [the Ukrainians] sucked you into it, with such a disgusting method,\u201d Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.</p> <p class=\"\">As the U.S. and its allies worked to paper over any disunity that could play into Moscow\u2019s hands, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Ukraine\u2019s top diplomat Wednesday to \u201cconvey information\u201d about what the U.S. has learned about the strike, the State Department said.</p> <p class=\"\">By Thursday, Kyiv appeared to be softening its stance.</p> <p class=\"\">Zelenskyy said that a team of Ukrainian specialists will take part in the probe of the blast site and suggested that only after the investigation will it be possible to draw definitive conclusions. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.

The world does not know,\u201d he said while answering questions at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. \u201cI am sure that it was a Russian missile, I am sure that we fired from air defense systems. But it is impossible to talk about something specific today.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Andrew S.

Washington now has a check and balance. The American people have a say in their government,\" McCarthy, flanked by his new leadership team, said Tuesday after he won his race to be the party's nominee for speaker.</p> <p class=\"\">Here\u2019s what the new 118th Congress will look like under House GOP rule:</p> <p class=\"\">Investigations will dominate the new Congress, from the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and allegations of politicization at the Justice Department to America's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. But none will attract as much attention as the GOP\u2019s planned investigation into the business dealings of the president\u2019s son Hunter two years before a potential Biden re-election bid.</p> <p class=\"\">Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the incoming Oversight Committee chairman, has said an investigation into Hunter Biden and other Biden family members and associates will be a priority as Republicans try to determine whether the family\u2019s business activities \u201ccompromise U.S. national security and President Biden\u2019s ability to lead with impartiality.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans allege that Hunter Biden has used his father\u2019s successful political career to enrich himself: He joined the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company in 2019, and an investment firm<a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/hunter-biden-and-the-cobalt-mine-explained/\"> he co-founded helped a Chinese firm</a> buy a Congolese cobalt mine from a U.S. company in 2016, among other financial endeavors.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cHunter and other members of the Biden family have a pattern of peddling access to the highest levels of government to enrich themselves,\u201d Comer said in a statement. \u201cThe American people deserve to know whether the President\u2019s connections to his family\u2019s business deals occurred at the expense of American interests and whether they represent a national security threat.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">At a press conference Thursday Comer and other House Republicans made clear that their investigation is focused on the sitting president.</p> <p class=\"\">\"We want the bank records and that\u2019s our focus,\" Comer said. \"We\u2019re trying to stay focused on: Was Joe Biden directly involved with Hunter Biden\u2019s business deals and is he compromised?

McCarthy has vowed to create a select committee to investigate China. And many other GOP members want to form a special panel to investigate the Biden administration\u2019s chaotic and deadly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan; a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/high-threat-terror-attack-disrupts-kabul-airport-evacuations-biden-deadline-n1277670\">killed 13 service members and scores of Afghans</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf there was one that I would say 100% needs to happen as a select committee, it\u2019s got to be Afghanistan,\u201d said Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., a member of the Homeland Security Committee who is expected to run for a leadership spot. \u201cWhen you look at the 13 Gold Star families that never should have been Gold Star families \u2014 for them alone, they deserve answers.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cBut for the equipment that got left behind, the Americans that got left behind, the families of those that we lost,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of answers that need to be uncovered.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">After House Democrats impeached President Donald Trump twice, some of his staunch allies in Congress are looking for payback. Far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has filed multiple articles of impeachment against Biden and Garland this Congress, although McCarthy said that so far he<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/19/mccarthy-impeachment-biden-gop-midterms/\"> hasn\u2019t seen anything</a> that rises to the level of impeachment.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">However, that\u2019s not expected to satisfy those on his right flank. A growing number of Republicans say they have their sights set on impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, bashing his handling of the border surge. In fiscal year 2022, there were a record<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/migrant-border-crossings-fiscal-year-2022-topped-276-million-breaking-rcna53517\"> 2.76 million</a> undocumented immigrant crossings, 1 million more than in the previous year, according to Customs and Border Protection data.

But the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention remain opposed, saying the bill \u2014 even with a newly added amendment aimed at attracting Republican support \u2014 is a dire threat to religious liberty.</p> <p class=\"\">A paramount concern for these leaders of the country\u2019s two largest denominations is that even the updated bill would not protect religious schools or faith-based nonprofits such as adoption and foster care providers.</p> <p class=\"\">The bill \u201cis an intentional attack on the religious freedom of millions of Americans with sincerely held beliefs about marriage, based on dictates of faith in God,\u201d leaders of the Missouri Baptist Convention, an SBC affiliate, said in a letter this week to U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican.</p> <p class=\"\">The letter failed to sway Blunt; he voted for the bill.</p> <p class=\"\">Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, chairman of the Catholic bishops\u2019 Committee for Religious Liberty, dismissed the bipartisan amendment as failing even the \u201cmeager goal\u201d of preserving the status quo in balancing religious freedom with the right to same-sex marriage.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe bill will be a new arrow in the quiver of those who wish to deny religious organizations\u2019 liberty to freely exercise their religious duties, strip them of their tax exemptions, or exclude them from full participation in the public arena,\u201d Dolan said earlier this week.</p> <p class=\"\">Meanwhile, many left-of-center faith leaders are cheering the bill, including some who planned a Thursday morning rally at the U.S. Capitol.

He previously served as chief of staff to the U.S. Senate majority leader and was secretary to the Senate finance committee.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s exciting work, it\u2019s fun work,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking to leave here.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">But the board reached out to Mujica, who sought to return to an island where he spent summers as a child and whose parents and grandparents are from the north coastal town of Arecibo.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt is an enormous challenge,\u201d he said of the new job. \u201cFor me to be part of the solution is exciting.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The U.S. Congress created the board in 2016, a year after Puerto Rico announced that it was unable to pay more than $70 billion of public debt accumulated through decades of mismanagement, corruption and excessive borrowing.</p> <p class=\"\">In 2017, Puerto Rico filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Nearly five years later, a federal judge in January approved a plan to slash the territory\u2019s debt and allow the government to start repaying creditors. Much of the debt has been restructured, but the $9 billion held by Puerto Rico\u2019s power company \u2014 the largest debt of any government agency \u2014 has yet to be resolved after mediation talks failed. Litigation has since resumed.</p> <p class=\"\">Mujica, who replaces Natalie Jaresko, will be in charge of a board that is overseeing the bankruptcy-like process and will remain in place until Puerto Rico\u2019s government approves four consecutive balanced budgets.</p> <p class=\"\">David Skeel, the board\u2019s chairman, said last year\u2019s budget might qualify as balanced, but the board can\u2019t confirm that until it receives the audited financials. So far, auditors are still reviewing Puerto Rico\u2019s 2019 budget.</p> <p class=\"\">Mujica declined to say whether he agrees with all the board\u2019s moves in recent years or comment on the actions of Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, with some acrimonious disagreements between the two ending up in court. He also declined to share his priorities, saying he needs to first get up to speed on everything.</p> <p class=\"\">Overall, Mujica said his goal is to support fiscal responsibility, promote long-term stability and ensure that revenues are consistent with spending needs. He noted that economic development is important but said it\u2019s unattainable if the island has an unstable budget or economy.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to govern year-by-year, but when you do that, you\u2019re not ready for the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cThe common goal is to serve the people on the island. There may be differences at times on how to achieve that. My role is to try and bridge that and come to an agreement as often as possible.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Mujica will join the board as a growing number of Puerto Ricans decry the austerity measures it has implemented amid demands for an economic development plan for an island still facing financial woes and struggling to recover from hurricanes that hit in recent years.</p> <p class=\"\">Critics also have noted that the ongoing bankruptcy process has cost Puerto Rico around $1 billion in consultants, lawyers and other expenses, and that the board\u2019s director earns $625,000 a year.</p> <p class=\"\">Skeel said the board unanimously chose Mujica after a search firm interviewed several dozen candidates, about five or six of those were then interviewed by the board.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cI cannot overstate how excited I am about Robert coming on board,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has the perfect background for what we have left\u201d to do.</p>"},

She is expected to remain, at least temporarily, given the GOP\u2019s razor-thin majority.</p> <p class=\"\">As Pelosi took the mic, the chamber was packed with Democratic lawmakers, while the Republican side of the aisle was largely empty \u2014 a symbol of how politics have changed over Pelosi\u2019s 3\u00bd decades in the House. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., did not attend or watch the speech, citing \"meetings,\" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., was present. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., crossed the Capitol to watch Pelosi speak, while the front row on the Democratic side of the chamber was filled with fellow female lawmakers from California.</p> <p class=\"\">Pelosi, 82, is one of the most powerful lawmakers of her generation or any other, and her departure will rob Democrats of strategic acumen and unmatched fundraising skills.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cShe\u2019s been at the center of the country\u2019s biggest crises, initiatives and showdowns for a quarter-century,\u201d Pelosi biographer Susan Page said. \u201cPeople can certainly disagree with her policies and her tactics. She hasn\u2019t done much to temper the partisan tone in Washington. But what you can\u2019t disagree with is this: She has gotten things done, even when almost everybody else thought they were impossible.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Pelosi's decision is expected to kick off a wave of generational change in Democratic leadership. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, 83, also announced Thursday that he will not seek another term in leadership. And Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina, 82, will not seek any of the top three spots in leadership, but has indicated that he plans to stay on in <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/rep-jim-clyburn-says-intends-stay-leadership-2023-rcna45966\">an \u201cadvisory\u201d role</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">Pelosi nodded at the coming changing of the guard in her speech. \"For me, the hour\u2019s come for a new generation to lead the Democratic Caucus that I so deeply respect, and I\u2019m so grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility.\"</p> <p class=\"\">Pelosi was a central player in passing the most significant laws in recent history, from President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health insurance measure and President Joe Biden\u2019s climate change initiative to President George W. Bush\u2019s Wall Street bailout and President Donald Trump\u2019s Covid-19 rescue programs.</p> <p class=\"\">\"I have enjoyed working with three presidents achieving historic investments in clean energy with President George Bush, transformative health care reform with President Barack Obama and forging the future from infrastructure to health care to climate action with President Joe Biden,\" Pelosi said Thursday; she did not mention Trump.</p> <p class=\"\">Her legacy is also one of institutional leadership outside the lines of policy. As she and other<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosi-said-new-jan-6-video-wanted-punch-trump-rcna52247\"> congressional leaders took refuge from rioters</a> during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Pelosi coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., then the Senate majority leader, and law enforcement to ensure the building would be cleared and Biden\u2019s election would be certified that day.</p> <p class=\"\">The attempt to sack the Capitol led Pelosi to start a record second impeachment of Trump during his final days in office.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cShe will go down in history, without equivocation, as the strongest, most effective, most powerful speaker the country has ever had. And her talents and skills are unmatched,\u201d Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., a top ally who represents a Bay Area district next to Pelosi\u2019s, told NBC News. \u201cSo I feel very fortunate to have served under her because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see anything like it again.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Biden spoke with Pelosi in Thursday morning and congratulated her on her historic tenure as speaker, the White House said. </p> <p class=\"\">\"Because of Nancy Pelosi, the lives of millions and millions of Americans are better, even in districts represented by Republicans who voted against her bills and too often vilify her,\" the president said in a statement. \"That\u2019s Nancy \u2014 always working for the dignity of all of the people.\"</p> <p class=\"\">Elected to the House in 1987 from a San Francisco-based district, Pelosi, the daughter and sister of Baltimore mayors, rose through the ranks of the House \u2014 from seats on its powerful spending and intelligence panels to Democratic whip, minority leader and speaker \u2014 on the strength of acute political instincts, big-time fundraising for a member of Congress and the ability to unify factions of an often-fractious caucus.</p> <p class=\"\">Colleagues have long pointed to her upbringing in old-school city machine politics \u2014 she kept a \u201cfavor file\u201d for her father \u2014 to explain what often seemed like an innate sense of how to reward, punish and cajole them to win support in leadership elections and on the legislative battlefield.</p> <p class=\"\">In her speech Thursday, Pelosi referred to her first trips to the Capitol with her father, Thomas D\u2019Alesandro Jr., when he represented Maryland in the House. \u201cWhen I first came to the floor at 6 years old, never would I have thought that someday I would go from homemaker to House speaker,\u201d she said.</p> <p class=\"\">Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., said: \u201cShe is the single best at the inside game that I\u2019ve ever seen or served with. She remembers every time a person has been with her on a vote and every time a person has been against her, and that memory is very important in that type of a position.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The fear of reprisal is one reason Pelosi hasn\u2019t been seriously challenged in a leadership election since she first won the post of Democratic whip over Hoyer in 2001. Since 2003, she has been her party\u2019s leader in the House, the longest streak in either party since Speaker Sam Rayburn, the Texas Democrat who died in 1961 after more than 21 years running his party.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cFor a woman, she\u2019s opened the doors wider for every last one of us,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who grew emotional talking about Pelosi. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not pleasant being on the other side of her, but I thank her for everything that she\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Early in her career, Pelosi demonstrated a rare touch for influencing colleagues.</p> <p class=\"\">When former Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., a progressive, launched a campaign for the chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee in 1994, Pelosi helped him whip votes to win the gavel, even though he was not the most senior member of the panel. The key, he said, was her knowledge of members\u2019 interests and personalities.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cShe had a book on everybody in her mind,\u201d Obey recalled in a telephone interview Thursday. \u201cShe understood what made each member tick.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Obey, who would return the favor by supporting Pelosi\u2019s leadership bids, called her \u201cvirtually irreplaceable.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">But Pelosi\u2019s longevity ultimately became a liability. Before the midterm elections, some of her fellow Democrats, including moderate Reps. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, openly called for<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/young-democrats-ready-plans-post-pelosi-shake-rcna52977\"> fresh blood</a> in the ranks of party leadership.</p> <p class=\"\">The calls continued in the days after the election \u2014 even with control of the House undecided.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWhether we hold the majority or lose it by one to five seats, it\u2019s time for a new generation of leadership. Period,\u201d Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., said shortly after the midterm elections.</p> <p class=\"\">The race to succeed Pelosi, as Democrats settle back into the minority after modest losses in this month\u2019s midterm elections, is expected to feature a series of next-generation candidates. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, 52, the Democratic Caucus chairman, has been considered Pelosi\u2019s heir apparent, and he would become the highest-ranking Black lawmaker in history if he were to win.</p> <p class=\"\">Pelosi has not indicated whom she would like to replace her as leader. Hoyer and Clyburn both endorsed Jeffries on Thursday. Hoyer called him \"a skilled and capable leader who will help us win back the majority in 2024\" and said \"he will make history for the institution of the House and for our country\" if he is elected leader. Clyburn also endorsed Reps. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Pete Aguilar of California for the No. 2 and No. 3 leadership spots, respectively.</p> <p class=\"\">Pelosi led Democrats to their first majority in a dozen years when they caught a blue wave in the 2006 midterm elections. Her colleagues rewarded her by making her speaker, a position she used to highlight America\u2019s struggles in the Iraq War and the Bush administration\u2019s role in the 2008 housing and finance industry crisis.</p> <p class=\"\">When Obama won the presidency that year, Pelosi and House Democrats expanded their majority. With newfound power and a Democratic Senate, they delivered an economic stimulus package, the so-called Dodd-Frank Wall Street regulations and the centerpiece of Obama\u2019s agenda, the Affordable Care Act. Pelosi was particularly instrumental in squeezing the latter program into law, negotiating among centrist Blue Dog Democrats, her party\u2019s dominant progressive wing and<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2009/11/bishops-reprise-old-abortion-fight-029606\"> the bishops of her own Roman Catholic religion</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cSomebody asked me if this was a victory for<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29270.html\"> Barack Obama</a>. It\u2019s not. This victory belongs to her,\u201d Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., the chairwoman of the Rules Committee at the time,<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2009/11/pelosi-wins-the-day-029281\"> said when the first version passed</a> in the House. \u201cAs far as I know she never sleeps nor eats.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The backlash to Obamacare helped Republicans knock Democrats out of power in the 2010 midterm elections, but Pelosi, with a smaller and more progressive caucus, held on to the reins of the party. She did it despite having been featured in millions of dollars of advertising against House Democratic candidates.</p> <p class=\"\">Eight years later, after Trump and Republicans tried to repeal Obamacare, she led Democrats to a midterm victory and was restored to the speakership.</p> <p class=\"endmark\"><strong>CORRECTION</strong> (Nov. 18, 2022, 12:50 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated how long Rep.

{"title": "As Trump announces 2024 run, GOP governors do their best to look away", "content": "<p class=\"\">ORLANDO, Fla.\u00a0\u2014 At the same time <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-announce-president-2024-rcna36987\">former President Donald Trump was declaring his third bid</a> for the White House on Tuesday night, a ballroom full of GOP governors, donors and lobbyists were tuned in to the Republican many have indicated they would prefer: Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">DeSantis, fresh off a decisive victory that reinforced Republicans\u2019 grip on power in his home state, made no mention of Trump, or the announcement taking place 168 miles away. The move by the party\u2019s de-facto leader hardly appeared to register \u2014 though the next presidential primary was top of mind.</p> <p class=\"\">In interviews, attendees of the annual meeting of the Republican Governors Association said there were plenty of discussions about 2024, what lessons the party can take from the midterms and how they should adjust their messaging. Those Republicans said they felt additional contenders were present at the conference as both <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/trump-biden-are-circling-governors-wait-2024-wings-rcna56852\">parties see a number of governors as attractive potential alternatives to Trump and President Joe Biden</a>, should the president\u2019s intent to seek re-election change.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI have no doubt,\u201d New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said when asked if there were GOP 2024 presidential candidates at the conference, adding that he thought DeSantis would run and that Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin might.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cPeople here are excited about a governor being president,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s clearly [what] at least this group of folks want to see.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine agreed: \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s more than one\u201d Republican at the conference thinking of launching a presidential bid, he said.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Republican governors had a mixed midterm result, much like Republicans elsewhere on the ballot. GOP incumbents like Sununu, DeWine and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who all cruised to re-election, far outpaced Republican candidates they shared the ticket with. They were also able to flip Nevada with Gov.-elect Joe Lombardo defeating the Democratic incumbent, Steve Sisolak; Lombardo was the only Trump-endorsed gubernatorial candidate to win a state Biden carried in 2020. (Through a representative, Lombardo declined an interview request.)</p> <p class=\"\">But Republican nominees for governor fell short in critical battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona \u2014\u00a0where the party lost control of the governors\u2019 mansion \u2014 with candidates who hugged Trump tightly. In deep-blue Massachusetts and Maryland, the GOP lost control of governorships after Trump promoted acolytes to succeed popular moderate Republican governors.</p> <p class=\"\">For attendees at the RGA conference, the lesson was less a departure from policies they promoted on the campaign trail and more a signal to move away from Trumpist-type messaging, even if governors were careful in how they phrased their takeaways. (Some were more direct: former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie received hearty applause at a panel that was not open to reporters after he blamed Trump for Republican failures in three consecutive elections, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/11/15/chris-christie-trump-governors\">Axios first reported</a>.)</p> <p class=\"\">Speaking at another panel, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said the lesson he took from the midterm elections was \u201cthat there is a real hunger in this country for competent leadership\" but \"that can be done so with a degree of civility that rarely exists in politics today.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI hope that we can, as a party \u2026 be those leaders for the people that are waiting for us to be,\u201d he added.</p> <p class=\"\">South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who was on the panel with Lee, said the party was failing to inspire young voters and needed to re-evaluate how it messaged toward that demographic \u201cbecause they\u2019re just buying the propaganda that\u2019s out there that\u2019s in their classrooms.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">She added Republicans should stop trying to generate attention by saying \u201ccrazy\u201d things.</p> <p class=\"\">Of 2024, Noem, who has generated some presidential buzz on the right and hails from the party\u2019s more Trump-friendly wing, said the election will \u201cbe interesting to see.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can predict it right now,\u201d she added.</p> <p class=\"\">Another focus of the conference was \u201celectability,\u201d with many Republicans expressing increased interest in making sure that candidates who emerged from primaries were best positioned to win in November.</p> <p class=\"\">Outgoing Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, who just finished a term as RGA co-chair, suggested that the group could get more involved in primaries. The RGA did spend to defend incumbents facing primaries but now may consider spending in open races.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cHistorically, the RGA has not been very involved in primaries, but that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re going to have to examine as we go forward, as well,\u201d Ricketts said.</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans here presented a united front on the issues they would seek to tackle, or continue addressing, over the next two years: cutting state-level taxes, boosting law enforcement, and further zeroing in on education and \u201cparental rights\u201d \u2014\u00a0a major theme of the 2022 campaigns. Republicans also discussed expanding vocational training opportunities in their states.</p> <p class=\"\">DeWine, who ran nearly 10 points ahead of GOP Sen.-elect J.D. Vance on the same ticket, said the disparity was likely the result of Democrats and independent voters rewarding him for how he handled pandemic policy \u2014\u00a0which, he said, showed voters will reward officials for \u201cnot being divisive.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThey want someone to lead, they want someone to pull people together,\u201d he said of voters. \u201cI don\u2019t think, by and large, they want someone to be divisive. Again, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not conservative, but they want action. They want results.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAs a party, we have to nominate people who can win general elections,\u201d he added. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have principles. But they have to be able to survive a general election. It does not make any sense to nominate someone who cannot win a general election. That\u2019s not how we govern, that\u2019s not how we get things done.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The Ohio governor, who has served in elected office for more than 40 years, said his fellow Republicans are right now on the same page regarding electability. \u201cThe question is whether that lasts,\u201d he said. \u201cBut certainly this week, that\u2019s what people understand.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">On Trump\u2019s announcement, DeWine said he did not think it would change the calculations for fellow GOP governors who might seek the presidency</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cPeople who are in politics,\u201d he said, \u201care always looking for presidential candidates who can win.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Sununu said Republicans did make some important gains last week \u2014\u00a0namely recapturing the House.

Minnesota was the fallback. Michigan is a key state.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The Democrat said one of the key factors that will be weighed is what kind of power Republicans hold in state offices, including governor and legislative chambers.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThere has to be a clear path for cooperation,\u201d the person said.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Minnesota Democrats have been making their own pitch to represent the Midwest in the early states.

Pelosi and her top two deputies \u2014 Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. \u2014 are all in their 80s and are receiving from within the party for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/young-democrats-ready-plans-post-pelosi-shake-rcna52977\" target=\"_blank\">new blood</a>\u201d in leadership; Hoyer will not seek another leadership post while Clyburn plans to stay on and work with the next generation.</p> <p class=\"\">Reps. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., are seeking to round out the new leadership team, announcing Friday that they will run for the No. 2 and No. 3 spots in leadership. Clark, 59, announced a bid for Democratic Whip, while Aguilar, 43, is running for Democratic Caucus Chair.</p> <p class=\"\">Pelosi endorsed all three to succeed her leadership team in a statement Friday, saying they are \"ready and willing to assume this awesome responsibility.\" Clyburn has also endorsed the three, while Hoyer backed Jeffries for leader on Thursday.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIn the 118th Congress, House Democrats will be led by a trio that reflects our beautiful diversity of our nation,\" Pelosi said. \"Chair Jeffries, Assistant Speaker Clark and Vice Chair Aguilar know that, in our Caucus, diversity is our strength and unity is our power.\"</p> <p class=\"\">Clyburn, a towering figure in the caucus and close ally of President Joe Biden, called his protege Jeffries \"absolutely fantastic\" and signaled support for a full slate of younger set of leaders taking the reins of the Democratic leadership apparatus: Jeffries, Clark, and Aguilar.</p> <p class=\"\">Clyburn said in a letter to colleagues Friday he will run for Assistant Democratic Leader in the next Congress \"to work alongside our new generation of Democratic Leaders which I hope to be Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark, and Pete Aguilar.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Added Hoyer: \"Well, I think it\u2019s always good for a party to have new blood and new invigoration, new enthusiasm, and new ideas.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">It's clear that Jeffries is the hands-down favorite for the job. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., had explored challenging Jeffries for the top job but dropped his bid Wednesday and instead will look at a potential run for the Senate, according to a source familiar with his planning. No other challengers have emerged.</p> <p class=\"\">Congressional Black Caucus Chair Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, said Thursday she was confident that the powerful bloc of more than 50 Black lawmakers would line up behind Jeffries.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries,\u201d Beatty told reporters Thursday.</p> <p class=\"\">NBC News projected Wednesday that Republicans will control the House for the next two years \u2014 but it will be a narrow majority, likely similar to the one Democrats have had since 2021.</p> <p class=\"\">Before Pelosi made her announcement, Hoyer grinned when asked whether House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who is running for speaker, will be able to govern with a small majority.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll see! Mr. Ryan and Mr. Boehner found it difficult,\u201d Hoyer said.</p> <p class=\"\">Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner both had larger majorities than the new one will be.</p> <p class=\"endmark\"><em>This is a developing story.

Brian Kemp in March 2021, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/georgia-passes-vast-restrictive-voting-law-limiting-early-voting-ballot-n1262101\" target=\"_blank\">cut in half the time</a> allowed between a general election and a runoff election \u2014 drastically shortening the period during which many voters must request, receive and cast ballots. The law's narrowed time frame also effectively cuts the early in-person voting period, from a minimum of 16 days in 2020 to a minimum of 5 in 2022, while existing rules have ensured almost no new voters will be eligible to vote in the runoff.</p> <p class=\"\">Proponents of the bill's provisions on runoffs argue that cutting the period eases a long and arduous process for everyone involved. The law's authors <a href=\"https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/201498\" target=\"_blank\">even wrote into the bill </a>that \"the lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and 120 electors.\" Other supporters, including Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer in the Office of the Georgia Secretary of State, note that before 2013, the state's runoff period was four weeks and that the elections ran without problems.</p> <p class=\"\">\"This is not the first time we've had to do this,\" Sterling said at <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?524156-1/georgia-secretary-state-brad-raffensperger-update-senate-runoff-election#\" target=\"_blank\">a news conference</a> last week. \"This is not that unique.\"</p> <p class=\"\">But voting rights advocates, both in Georgia and around the country, say the new law's changes present challenges. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt was not just that the runoff date was moved up, it\u2019s that the period to get so many steps done has been condensed,\u201d said Danielle Lang, the senior director of the voting rights unit at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan voting watchdog group.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe big takeaway here is that the compressing of the time line for a runoff has spillover effects on access for voters,\u201d she said.</p> <p class=\"\">Here are several of the ways the new law could affect voters in the runoff.</p> <p class=\"\">Under SB 202, Georgia runoff elections now take place 28 days after the general election \u2014 less than half the original nine-week period that existed before the law. This year\u2019s runoff will take place on Dec. 6, following the Nov. 8 midterms. </p> <p class=\"\">The law, however, does not change an existing rule that voters must register at least 30 days before an election.</p> <p class=\"\">As a result, new voters who weren\u2019t registered for the general election <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/georgia-organizations-push-keep-black-voters-energized-crucial-senate-rcna57160\">will not be able to register </a>in time to vote in the runoff  because the deadline will have already passed.</p> <p class=\"\">That\u2019s a stark difference from the landscape in the state in 2020 \u2014 that year both of the state\u2019s U.S. Senate races advanced to a runoff that would determine control of the chamber \u2014 when candidates and outside groups rushed to register droves of new voters.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe bottom line is that nobody can vote in this runoff who didn\u2019t register as of Nov. 7,\u201d said Lang. She added there\u2019s likely still a narrow new pool of voters who registered too late to vote in the general election but could make the 30-day deadline for the runoff.</p> <p class=\"\">Domestic, absentee mail-in ballot voters will now have a much shorter window in which to do everything required of them to cast their ballots on time.</p> <p class=\"\">Before SB 202, these voters would have had nine weeks to request an absentee ballot, receive that ballot and mail it in or drop it off. Now they will have to do all that in half the time.</p> <p class=\"\">Under existing runoff procedures, most Georgians who want to cast an absentee mail-in ballot (voters 65 and older and disabled voters will be sent an absentee mail-in ballot automatically if registered to vote) must first request such a ballot, in compliance with the law's new voter ID requirement. The deadline for local election officials to receive those absentee ballot applications is Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving. </p> <p class=\"\">If most voters don\u2019t mail their applications well before the Nov. 25 deadline, local election officials could be dealing with a backlog upon returning from the Thanksgiving weekend on Monday Nov. 28 \u2014 the same day early in-person voting will begin in most counties.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The law mandates that the ballots must be mailed to voters within three days of receipt of the applications \u2014 a tight time frame that advocates warn may not be met, given that the deadline overlaps with a holiday and comes just days before the start of early in-person voting.</p> <p class=\"\">Once voters receive their absentee ballots, they must choose their candidates and mail those ballots back, again in compliance with the voter ID requirement. Absentee mail-in ballots received before 7 p.m. on the day of the election \u2014 Dec. 6 \u2014 will be counted, per Georgia\u2019s law. Voters may also deposit their absentee ballots in drop boxes.</p> <p class=\"\">Voting rights activists, who have worked to bolster awareness of the new rules through voter education initiatives, expressed concern that the deadlines would sneak up on voters, especially with the holiday.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe shorter time frame may be a challenge to voters who don't realize how quickly some of these deadline are going to come up or who haven't thought through how they are going to vote,\u201d said Andrew Garber, an attorney at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Under a separate provision of SB 202, overseas and military absentee voters were provided a ranked choice voting ballot as their general election ballot weeks before the general election so that, in the event of a runoff, their vote would have already been mailed in. </p> <p class=\"\">This keeps SB 202 in compliance with a federal law requiring that overseas and military absentee voters be mailed their ballots 45 days before a federal election.</p> <p class=\"\">Because of the condensed time frame between the general election and the runoff, many Georgia voters will also be looking at a shortened, five-day, weekday-only period of early in-person voting.</p> <p class=\"\">Plus, due to an ongoing lawsuit against the state, it remains uncertain whether one Saturday early voting day, on Nov. 26, will be allowed.</p> <p class=\"\">SB 202 stipulates that early in-person voting must end the Friday before the runoff. This year, that would be Friday Dec. 2. </p> <p class=\"\">The law, as interpreted by the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office,<strong> </strong>also stipulates that early in-person voting not be held on any Saturday that follows a \u201cpublic or legal holiday\u201d on the preceding Thursday or Friday. This year, that would mean there would be no early in-person voting on Nov. 26, the Saturday following Thanksgiving. </p> <p class=\"\">But a Fulton County judge <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/win-democrats-georgia-judge-allows-early-voting-senate-runoff-saturday-rcna57983\" target=\"_blank\">ruled Friday that the office</a> cannot prohibit counties from allowing voting that day, after a voting rights group, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/us/politics/warnock-early-voting-georgia.html\" target=\"_blank\">along with Warnock</a> and his campaign, <a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/democrats-sue-georgia-over-early-voting-guidance-for-senate-runoff/\">sued</a> the state, claiming  the specific language of the law suggested that the barring of Saturday voting after a holiday \u2014 in this case Thanksgiving \u2014 doesn\u2019t actually apply to runoff elections.</p> <p class=\"\">Georgia\u2019s attorney general plans to appeal, a spokesperson for the office told NBC News. As a result, whether counties can offer voting that day remains in limbo.</p> <p class=\"\">If voting is ultimately not allowed on that Saturday, SB 202 says Saturday voting should be held the previous weekend (in this year\u2019s case, Saturday, Nov. 19). But under Georgia law, runoff voting may not begin until after officials have certified the general election vote, which will be on Monday, Nov. 21, per the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office. That means, no Saturday voting will be allowed on Nov. 19, either. </p> <p class=\"\">Whether the judiciary allows voting on Nov. 26 or not, the only other days most voters will  be able to vote early in-person will be from Monday Nov. 28 to Friday Dec. 2. The law states that early voting \u201cshall end on the Friday immediately prior to each primary, election, or runoff.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">That five-day period, however, represents the minimum required under the law, and county election officials have the discretion to schedule additional early-in person voting days that comply with the law's other rules, Lang and Garber and others said.</p> <p class=\"\">Voting rights groups have pushed Georgia counties, for example, to open early-in person voting on Nov. 22, 23 and 27 (the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after). As of Friday, at least nine of the state's 159 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabrielSterling/status/1593622135716470784\" target=\"_blank\">counties</a> had <a href=\"https://www.cobbcounty.org/elections/voting/advance-voting\" target=\"_blank\">opened up Nov. 27</a> for early voting, and a smaller handful <a href=\"https://www.celebratedouglascounty.com/545/Advance-Voting\" target=\"_blank\">opened </a>it up for Nov. 22 and 23.<strong> </strong></p> <p class=\"\">During the 2020 runoff election, many voters had a period of several weeks to vote early in person \u2014 and all had the possibility to do so on at least on one Saturday.</p> <p class=\"\">Voting rights experts warn that SB 202\u2019s restrictions on drop boxes will also affect the ease with which many absentee voters can drop off their ballots.</p> <p class=\"\">The law says such drop boxes can be located only inside election offices, and early voting locations and are available only during the office or polling site's hours of operation.</p> <p class=\"\">This year, these drop boxes will be available only during early in-person voting. In the counties that adhere to the minimum requirement \u2014 Monday to Friday the week before the election \u2014 those same limitations will also affect drop-box access. How the judiciary rules on the Nov. 26 issue would also be a factor here.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIn 2020, if you had had an absentee ballot and were worried whether it would arrive at an election office on time, you could go drop of it off on a Saturday,\" said Rahul Garabadu, a senior voting rights attorney at the Georgia American Civil Liberties Union. \"But now because of SB 202, you can only do that during the hours of early voting, which can often be a regular 9-to-5.\"</p> <p class=\"\">As a result, he suggested, more people may choose to mail in their ballot instead \u2014 a fact that then brings into play any potential postal delays.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cAll of these provisions interact with each other,\u201d Garabadu said. \u201cWhen they combine, you see a cumulative effect on voters, which makes it tougher to cast their ballots.\u201d</p>"},

This is pure, progressive, power politics,\u201d Kaufmann told NBC News Friday. Kaufmann\u2019s position could complicate the overall schedule even more since New Hampshire has a law on the books that it has to hold its primary just after Iowa\u2019s caucuses.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf, for some reason, California and New York dictate policy for the entire DNC and they give the middle finger to Iowa and the Midwest \u2014 if that happens, we will be first,\u201d Kaufmann said. \u201cI\u2019ll move this thing to Halloween if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The caucuses are typically not scheduled until January or early February of the same year as the presidential race.</p> <p class=\"\">Kaufmann also laid into President Biden\u2019s agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, a onetime presidential contender and former Iowa governor, saying he and other Democratic leaders weren\u2019t doing enough to preserve Iowa\u2019s first place in line. Vilsack did not respond to a request for comment. Kaufmann argued it was detrimental to the entire system if Democrats pulled out of Iowa as a first-in-the-nation caucus since the two parties typically agree to hold their caucuses on the same day.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Iowa\u2019s Democratic Party Chair Ross Wilburn noted that even if Democrats put the state later, Republicans would still be campaigning in Iowa early<strong> </strong>and testing their messages to rural voters, putting Democrats at a disadvantage with that electorate if they abandon the smaller state.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe can\u2019t allow our presidential campaigns to be solely decided by campaigns that can only afford TV ads or by corporate special interest groups who have the funds to pay for their candidate to get exposure in larger media markets,\u201d Wilburn said. \u201cWe believe we need to have small rural states like Iowa, in the mix.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The discussion comes after Democrats scrapped the old calendar and opened up the process so all states could apply to be early contenders. That old system began with the Iowa caucuses, then went to the New Hampshire primary, Nevada and South Carolina.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">These early positions are prized since they create an economic bump in states that are flooded with advertising dollars and on-the-ground organizations.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Dozens of states have now applied to take one of the early state positions.\u00a0They include all of the states that have previously gone early, while Nevada is attempting to replace New Hampshire as the first-in-the-nation primary. Both Minnesota and Michigan are making plays to move into a Midwestern slot should Iowa be dropped from the early rotation. </p> <p class=\"endmark\">The Democratic National Committee\u2019s rules and bylaws committee is scheduled to meet in early December in Washington to discuss the presidential primary schedule. </p>"},

But what he got might be just enough to irritate his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p class=\"\">The Biden administration had been hoping the summit, which brought together the world\u2019s 20 largest economies, would produce a communiqu\u00e9 that strongly condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, with as many nations as possible signing on.</p> <p class=\"\">The document released at the end of the conference is carefully worded, with the feel of a hard-fought compromise. The section on Ukraine says that \u201cmost members\u201d strongly condemned the war and the \u201cimmense human suffering\u201d it has caused, while noting that \u201cthere were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">There is no breakdown provided of which members fell into which group. But G-20 members like China, India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, which have stronger relationships with Moscow, have largely refrained from publicly criticizing Russia over its actions and tried to appear neutral in the conflict.</p> <p class=\"\">The language also does not explicitly fault Russia, another G-20 member. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-president-vladimir-putin-will-not-attend-g-20-summit-indonesia-rcna56534\" target=\"_blank\">attended the summit in place of Putin</a>, had accused Western countries on Tuesday of trying to \u201cpoliticize\u201d the joint statement.</p> <p class=\"\">In another passage that seems at least partly aimed at Putin, the statement says \u201cthe use or threat of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.\u201d The Russian president has denied that he intends to use nuclear weapons to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-kherson-retreat-putin-war-ukraine-what-it-means-rcna56537\" target=\"_blank\">reverse battlefield losses</a>, but he raised alarms in September when he warned that he was prepared to use \u201call means available to protect Russia.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Communiqu\u00e9s tend to have a short shelf life, of interest mainly to the diplomats who negotiate and write them. Still, when Putin sees the document it is hard to imagine he\u2019ll be pleased. As it was being crafted, one Biden administration official told reporters: \u201cI think what you will see is that most countries of the G-20 will be clear that Russia\u2019s war of aggression is being condemned in the strongest possible terms.\u201d</p> <p class=\"styles_authors__pctbg\"><span class=\"byline-name\">Chantal Da Silva</span></p> <p class=\"\">Ukraine's foreign minister said he spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a phone call Tuesday and called for a \"stiff and principled\" response to the blast that killed two people in Poland. </p> <p class=\"\">Dmytro Kuleba said in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/status/1592684943783886848\" target=\"_blank\">tweet </a>he had a \"detailed call\" with Blinken on \"Russian missile terror,\" during which he stressed the importance of a rigid response to the deadly explosion Tuesday.</p> <p class=\"\">Blinken acknowledged in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecBlinken/status/1592729390286532610\" target=\"_blank\">tweet </a>that he had discussed the blast with Kuleba, but he did not expand on the details of the conversation. \"We are committed to be with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" he said.</p> <p class=\"\">Kuleba has accused Russia of peddling a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d by suggesting that the strike in Poland was caused by an errant Ukrainian air defense missile. \u201cNo one should buy Russian propaganda or amplify its messages,\u201d he said earlier on Twitter.</p> <p class=\"styles_authors__pctbg\"><span class=\"byline-name\"><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/author/patrick-smith-ncpn989401\">Patrick Smith</a></span></p> <p class=\"\">Poland's neighboring NATO and European Union allies responded with a mixture of patient concern and anger to the explosion Tuesday.</p> <p class=\"\">Lithuania's defense minister, Artis Pabriks, said in a tweet: \"[The] criminal Russian regime fired missiles which target not only Ukrainian civilians but also landed on NATO territory in Poland.\"</p> <p class=\"\">Others, however, were more reserved.

But what he got might be just enough to irritate his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p class=\"\">The Biden administration had been hoping the summit, which brought together the world\u2019s 20 largest economies, would produce a communiqu\u00e9 that strongly condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, with as many nations as possible signing on.</p> <p class=\"\">The document released at the end of the conference is carefully worded, with the feel of a hard-fought compromise. The section on Ukraine says that \u201cmost members\u201d strongly condemned the war and the \u201cimmense human suffering\u201d it has caused, while noting that \u201cthere were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">There is no breakdown provided of which members fell into which group. But G-20 members like China, India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, which have stronger relationships with Moscow, have largely refrained from publicly criticizing Russia over its actions and tried to appear neutral in the conflict.</p> <p class=\"\">The language also does not explicitly fault Russia, another G-20 member. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-president-vladimir-putin-will-not-attend-g-20-summit-indonesia-rcna56534\" target=\"_blank\">attended the summit in place of Putin</a>, had accused Western countries on Tuesday of trying to \u201cpoliticize\u201d the joint statement.</p> <p class=\"\">In another passage that seems at least partly aimed at Putin, the statement says \u201cthe use or threat of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.\u201d The Russian president has denied that he intends to use nuclear weapons to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-kherson-retreat-putin-war-ukraine-what-it-means-rcna56537\" target=\"_blank\">reverse battlefield losses</a>, but he raised alarms in September when he warned that he was prepared to use \u201call means available to protect Russia.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Communiqu\u00e9s tend to have a short shelf life, of interest mainly to the diplomats who negotiate and write them. Still, when Putin sees the document it is hard to imagine he\u2019ll be pleased.
