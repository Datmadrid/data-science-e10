<p class="">Doug Mastriano, the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/doug-mastriano-posed-confederate-uniform-army-war-college-rcna45078" target="_blank">far-right Republican</a> backed by Donald Trump, doesn't believe the former president lost in 2020. But on Sunday, he conceded his own defeat for governor of Pennsylvania with humility.</p> <p class="">"Difficult to accept as the results are, there is no right course but to concede," Mastriano said in <a href="https://twitter.com/dougmastriano/status/1591925822268788737" target="_blank">one-page statement</a> Sunday. "Josh Shapiro will be our next Governor, and I ask everyone to give him the opportunity to lead and pray that he leads well."</p> <p class="">Mastriano conceded nearly five days after Election Day, a delay his opponent saw <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3733182-shapiro-on-mastriano-not-calling-to-concede-who-cares/" target="_blank">as insignificant</a>. The race was one of two major contests in the state that tested the temperature of the nation amid speculation that Trump will run again in 2024.</p> <p class="">Democrats won in both races in a state that has sizable populations of Black and Latino Democrats, as well as an aging white working class that the GOP has targeted for support.</p> <p class="">In the other contest, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, bested Trump-supported celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz for a Senate seat. </p> <p class="">The win flipped the seat from red to blue and contributed to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/democrats-maintain-control-senate-nbc-news-projects-defeating-many-tru-rcna56677" target="_blank">the Democrats' continued control of the Senate</a> after midterm elections that had been widely expected to reverse Democrats' tenuous hold on Congress.</p> <p class="">In his statement, Mastriano didn't doubt the veracity of the results in his own loss, saying, "In all, we received votes from almost 2.2 million Pennsylvanians, and I thank every one of you, from the bottom of my heart."</p> <p class="">Mastriano, a former Army colonel known for extreme stances — he says violators of a proposed ban on abortion for women who are six weeks pregnant should face murder charges — sounded relatively moderate on paper Sunday. </p> <p class="">But he continued to doubt the American election system.</p> <p class="">"Pennsylvania is in great need of election reform," he wrote. "We can and must do better to make our elections more transparent, secure, and more quickly decided."</p> <p class="endmark">NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/josh-shapiro-declared-winner-2022-pennsylvania-governor-midterm-electi-rcna55169" target="_blank">called</a> Mastriano's race Tuesday night.</p>
