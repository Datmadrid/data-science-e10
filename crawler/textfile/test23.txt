<p class="">President Joe Biden said Monday that he did not expect Democrats to have enough votes in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/midterm-elections-2022?icid=election_nav" target="_blank">Congress</a> to be able to pass legislation codifying Roe v. Wade</p> <p class="">Asked at a news conference in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-will-seek-establish-red-lines-high-stakes-meeting-chinas-xi-rcna56970" target="_blank">Bali, Indonesia</a>, what Americans could expect Congress to do about abortion access, Biden said: “I don’t think they can expect much of anything other than we’re going to maintain our positions.”</p> <p class="">“I don’t think there’s enough votes to codify unless something happens unusual in the House,” Biden said.</p> <p class="">“I think we’re going to get very close in the House,” he added. “But I don’t think we’re going to make it.”</p> <p class="">Control of the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/house-results?icid=election_usmap" target="_blank">House remains unresolved</a> as vote-counting in the midterm elections continues; Republicans remain the favorite to control of the chamber by a narrow majority. </p> <p class="">Democrats have kept <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/biden-democrats-celebrate-retaining-control-senate-rcna56956" target="_blank">control of the Senate</a>, but passing a bill through it would likely require 60 votes, which would necessitate about 10 Republicans’ supporting it. </p> <p class="">Exit polls showed that abortion was a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/inflation-abortion-top-issues-us-voters-casting-midterm-ballots-exit-poll-finds-2022-11-08/" target="_blank">major motivating issue</a> for voters this election cycle. </p> <p class="">Although Democrats performed surprisingly well in the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/midterm-elections-2022" target="_blank">midterm elections</a>, Biden’s remarks Monday underscore the limitations of his policy agenda as he adjusts to what will likely be a divided Congress.</p> <p class="">Biden said at the news conference that the midterm elections demonstrated “the strength and resilience in American democracy” through voters’ “strong rejection of election deniers at every level.”</p> <p class="">“What these elections showed is that there’s a deep, unwavering commitment in America to preserving and protecting and defending democracy,” Biden said.</p> <p class="">Biden is traveling overseas for a series of international conferences. He attended the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-cop-27-climate-change-rcna56750" target="_blank">United Nations summit</a> on climate change in Egypt last week and is in Bali for the annual meeting of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations.</p> <p class="endmark">Biden said that throughout his trip it has “been clear just how closely the world, our allies and our competitors, as well, have been following our elections at home.”</p>
