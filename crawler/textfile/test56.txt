<p class="">Philadelphia officials lashed out at Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday after a 10-year-old girl who arrived in Philadelphia on a bus of migrants from Texas was hospitalized with dehydration and a fever.</p> <p class="">The bus carried 28 people in total, five of them children, Philadelphia officials said at a news conference Wednesday. Abbott’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the child.</p> <p class="">Philadelphia City Council member Helen Gym, a Democrat, told NBC Philadelphia that "it’s one of the more inhumane aspects that they would put a child who was dehydrated with a fever now, a very high fever," on the bus.</p> <p class="">Abbott, a Republican who was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/texas-governor-election-2022-greg-abbott-wins-rcna54924" target="_blank">re-elected to a third term</a> last week, announced in a <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-announces-first-bus-of-migrants-departs-for-philadelphia" target="_blank">news release</a> Tuesday that his administration would be sending migrants to Philadelphia from his state for the first time Wednesday. </p> <p class="">"Until the Biden Administration does its job and provides Texans and the American people with sustainable border security, Texas will continue doing more than any other state in the nation’s history to defend against an invasion along the border, including adding more sanctuary cities like Philadelphia as drop-off locations for our busing strategy," he said. </p> <p class="">Abbott's office said Philadelphia is an "ideal addition to Texas' list of drop-off locations" for migrants because, it said, the city's mayor, Jim Kenney, "has long-celebrated and fought for sanctuary city status."</p> <p class="">Kenney, a Democrat, expressed outrage Wednesday at Abbott for his tactics. Kenney said his office was told last week that a bus of about 30 asylum-seekers would be expected to travel to his city from Del Rio, Texas, but he said Texas officials did not coordinate their arrival.</p> <p class="">"This information was confirmed late yesterday without coordination or warning by Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s office through a press release," Kenney said at the city officials' news conference. "It’s not just unproductive and disappointing, but downright irresponsible and callous to do this unannounced and without coordination, showing blatant disregard for the sanctity of human lives."</p> <p class="">Kenney emphasized that the migrants are welcome in Philadelphia, saying officials are "focused as ever on welcoming and supporting anyone who wants to visit or live in our great city." </p> <p class="">"Gov. Abbott and his administration continue to implement their cruel and racist policies," he continued, saying Abbott is "using immigrant families, including children, as pawns to shamelessly push their warped political agenda." </p> <p class="">Abbott <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/BidenJoseph_11.16.22.pdf" target="_blank">warned President Joe Biden</a> in a letter Wednesday that Texas would ramp up its efforts to deal with the influx of migrants. He said Biden must implement or reinstate policies that enforce federal immigration laws "and protect the states against invasion."</p> <p class="">"Two years of inaction on your part now leave Texas with no choice but to escalate our efforts to secure our State," the letter said. "Your open-border policies, which have catalyzed an unprecedented crisis of illegal immigration, are the sole cause of Texas having to invoke our constitutional authority to defend ourselves."</p> <p class="">A federal judge ruled Tuesday that the U.S. government can no longer use <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/dhs-officials-concerned-may-need-2-billion-deal-migrant-surge-border-d-rcna29792" target="_blank">a Trump-era policy </a>that allowed authorities to severely limit asylum-seekers from crossing the border into the country during the height of the Covid pandemic. The Biden administration, which has sought to end the policy, said later Tuesday it wouldn't oppose the judge's order.</p> <p class="endmark">In recent months, Abbott has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/top-border-official-hits-back-texas-gov-abbott-busing-migrants-washing-rcna24489" target="_blank">repeatedly sent migrants</a> on buses from Texas to other major cities, including New York and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/migrants-arrive-dc-buses-sent-gop-texas-gov-greg-abbott-rcna24229" target="_blank">Washington, D.C.</a> Florida Gov.
