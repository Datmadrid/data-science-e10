<p class="">WASHINGTON — The House Jan. 6 committee on Thursday interviewed Bobby Engel, who was the lead Secret Service agent for then-President Donald Trump when the insurrection took place, three sources familiar with the session said. </p> <p class="">Engel could provide key testimony related to information shared by Cassidy Hutchinson, who was a top aide to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She delivered <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/cassidy-hutchinson-trump-lunged-secret-service-agent-tried-grab-steeri-rcna35775" target="_blank">bombshell testimony</a> before the committee at a public hearing this summer.</p> <p class="">Hutchinson testified that she was told <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump" target="_blank">Trump</a> tried to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/cassidy-hutchinson-trump-lunged-secret-service-agent-tried-grab-steeri-rcna35775" target="_blank">grab the steering wheel</a> in an armored SUV and lunged toward his security detail when he learned he would not be taken to the Capitol after his rally on Jan. 6.</p> <p class="">Hutchinson said Tony Ornato, the White House deputy chief of staff for operations, told her about the incident. She also said Engel had not disputed Ornato’s account. Ornato and Engel both testified before the committee before Hutchinson.</p> <p class="">The Jan. 6 panel declined to comment on Engel’s interview.
