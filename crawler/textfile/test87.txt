At least 23 of those spies were in the U.K., he said. </p> <p class="">Still, he said British spies had to contend with a “Russian covert toolkit” including assassination attempts “cyberattacks, disinformation, espionage” and interfering with democracy.</p> <p class="">In a speech outlining the major threats to the U.K., McCallum said there was also a risk Russia, China and Iran could help one another, “amplifying their strengths.”</p> <p class="styles_authors__pctbg"><span class="byline-name">Artem Grudinin</span> and <span class="byline-name">Chantal Da Silva</span></p> <p class="">Ukraine called for a "joint study" of the blast in Poland that killed two people on Tuesday, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said. </p> <p class="">"We are ready to hand over the evidence of the Russian trail that we have," Danilov said in a tweet on Wednesday. "We are expecting information from our partners, on the basis of which a conclusion was made that it is a Ukrainian air defense missile."</p> <p class="">Danilov said Ukraine was requesting "immediate access to the site of the explosion" to investigate the incident. </p> <p class="styles_authors__pctbg"><span class="byline-name">Max Burman</span></p> <p class="">The Kremlin decried what it said was a "rabid Russophobic reaction" to the deadly blast in Poland but hailed what it described as the "much more professional" response from Washington.</p> <p class="">"We have witnessed another hysterical, rabid Russophobic reaction, which was not based on any real data," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a briefing Wednesday.</p> <p class="">"It is worth paying attention to the restrained and much more professional reaction of the American side and the American president," Peskov added.</p> <p class="styles_authors__pctbg"><span class="byline-name">Jean-Nicholas Fievet</span> and <span class="byline-name">Laura Saravia</span></p> <p class="">Tuesday's explosion in Poland was most likely not the result of a deliberate attack and there is no indication that Russia is preparing offensive military operations against NATO, the alliance's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said.</p> <p class="">Preliminary analysis indicated that the blast, which killed two Polish citizens near the border with Ukraine, was caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile fired in defense against Russian cruise missile attacks, Stoltenberg said at a news conference in Brussels on Wednesday. </p> <p class="">Stoltenberg said he wanted to "be clear" that "this is not Ukraine's fault."</p> <p class="">"Russia bears ultimate responsibility, as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine," he said.</p> <p class="styles_authors__pctbg"><span class="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/f-brinley-bruton--ncpn721">F.

Both sources said the investigation was ongoing and that was not yet certain.</p> <p class="">Belgium's defense minister said early Wednesday that the blast appears to be the result of “Ukrainian air defense.” </p> <p class="">Western officials have stressed that no matter who fired the missile, Russia's war was ultimately responsible for the incident. "One thing is clear: This would not have happened without Russia’s horrific missile attacks against Ukraine," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said.</p> <p class="styles_authors__pctbg"><span class="byline-name">Kriti Gandhi</span> and <span class="byline-name">Reuters</span></p> <p class="">The explosion in NATO member Poland’s territory has raised concerns about Russia’s war in Ukraine spreading to neighboring countries. The transatlantic military alliance was meeting in Brussels on Wednesday. </p> <p class="">Article 4 of the NATO treaty states that all NATO members “will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.”</p> <p class="">The blast has prompted speculation about NATO’s Article 5, which states that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all."</p> <p class="">It also states that parties "agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.” </p> <p class="">Article 5 is not automatically invoked. Member countries must come together to evaluate a situation and determine whether it should be triggered. </p> <p class="">It was not triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February because Ukraine is not a part of NATO. Article 5 has been activated once before, on behalf of the United States in response to the 9/11 attacks in 2001. </p> <p class="styles_authors__pctbg"><span class="byline-name">Chantal Da Silva</span> and <span class="byline-name">Jean-Nicholas Fievet</span></p> <p class="">The deadly blast in Przewodów appears to be the result of "Ukrainian air defense," Belgium's defense minister said early Wednesday. </p> <p class="">"Based on current information, the strikes in Poland seem to be a result of Ukrainian air defense," Ludivine Dedonder said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/DedonderLudivin/status/1592780532945125376" target="_blank">tweet</a>.</p> <p class="">"Pieces of Russian missiles and a Ukrainian interception missile are said to have landed in Poland," the defense minister said. Dedonder said investigations were underway to confirm the cause of the blast. </p> <p class="">NBC News has not verified the details and Poland has not said who might have fired the missile, only that it was "Russian-made."

But what he got might be just enough to irritate his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p class="">The Biden administration had been hoping the summit, which brought together the world’s 20 largest economies, would produce a communiqué that strongly condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, with as many nations as possible signing on.</p> <p class="">The document released at the end of the conference is carefully worded, with the feel of a hard-fought compromise. The section on Ukraine says that “most members” strongly condemned the war and the “immense human suffering” it has caused, while noting that “there were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions.”</p> <p class="">There is no breakdown provided of which members fell into which group. But G-20 members like China, India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, which have stronger relationships with Moscow, have largely refrained from publicly criticizing Russia over its actions and tried to appear neutral in the conflict.</p> <p class="">The language also does not explicitly fault Russia, another G-20 member. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-president-vladimir-putin-will-not-attend-g-20-summit-indonesia-rcna56534" target="_blank">attended the summit in place of Putin</a>, had accused Western countries on Tuesday of trying to “politicize” the joint statement.</p> <p class="">In another passage that seems at least partly aimed at Putin, the statement says “the use or threat of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.” The Russian president has denied that he intends to use nuclear weapons to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-kherson-retreat-putin-war-ukraine-what-it-means-rcna56537" target="_blank">reverse battlefield losses</a>, but he raised alarms in September when he warned that he was prepared to use “all means available to protect Russia.”</p> <p class="">Communiqués tend to have a short shelf life, of interest mainly to the diplomats who negotiate and write them. Still, when Putin sees the document it is hard to imagine he’ll be pleased. As it was being crafted, one Biden administration official told reporters: “I think what you will see is that most countries of the G-20 will be clear that Russia’s war of aggression is being condemned in the strongest possible terms.”</p> <p class="styles_authors__pctbg"><span class="byline-name">Chantal Da Silva</span></p> <p class="">Ukraine's foreign minister said he spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a phone call Tuesday and called for a "stiff and principled" response to the blast that killed two people in Poland. </p> <p class="">Dmytro Kuleba said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/status/1592684943783886848" target="_blank">tweet </a>he had a "detailed call" with Blinken on "Russian missile terror," during which he stressed the importance of a rigid response to the deadly explosion Tuesday.</p> <p class="">Blinken acknowledged in a <a href="https://twitter.com/SecBlinken/status/1592729390286532610" target="_blank">tweet </a>that he had discussed the blast with Kuleba, but he did not expand on the details of the conversation.

Member countries must come together to evaluate a situation and determine whether it should be triggered. </p> <p class="">It was not triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February because Ukraine is not a part of NATO.

But what he got might be just enough to irritate his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p class="">The Biden administration had been hoping the summit, which brought together the world’s 20 largest economies, would produce a communiqué that strongly condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, with as many nations as possible signing on.</p> <p class="">The document released at the end of the conference is carefully worded, with the feel of a hard-fought compromise. The section on Ukraine says that “most members” strongly condemned the war and the “immense human suffering” it has caused, while noting that “there were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions.”</p> <p class="">There is no breakdown provided of which members fell into which group. But G-20 members like China, India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, which have stronger relationships with Moscow, have largely refrained from publicly criticizing Russia over its actions and tried to appear neutral in the conflict.</p> <p class="">The language also does not explicitly fault Russia, another G-20 member. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-president-vladimir-putin-will-not-attend-g-20-summit-indonesia-rcna56534" target="_blank">attended the summit in place of Putin</a>, had accused Western countries on Tuesday of trying to “politicize” the joint statement.</p> <p class="">In another passage that seems at least partly aimed at Putin, the statement says “the use or threat of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.” The Russian president has denied that he intends to use nuclear weapons to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-kherson-retreat-putin-war-ukraine-what-it-means-rcna56537" target="_blank">reverse battlefield losses</a>, but he raised alarms in September when he warned that he was prepared to use “all means available to protect Russia.”</p> <p class="">Communiqués tend to have a short shelf life, of interest mainly to the diplomats who negotiate and write them. Still, when Putin sees the document it is hard to imagine he’ll be pleased. As it was being crafted, one Biden administration official told reporters: “I think what you will see is that most countries of the G-20 will be clear that Russia’s war of aggression is being condemned in the strongest possible terms.”</p> <p class="styles_authors__pctbg"><span class="byline-name">Chantal Da Silva</span></p> <p class="">Ukraine's foreign minister said he spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a phone call Tuesday and called for a "stiff and principled" response to the blast that killed two people in Poland. </p> <p class="">Dmytro Kuleba said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/status/1592684943783886848" target="_blank">tweet </a>he had a "detailed call" with Blinken on "Russian missile terror," during which he stressed the importance of a rigid response to the deadly explosion Tuesday.</p> <p class="">Blinken acknowledged in a <a href="https://twitter.com/SecBlinken/status/1592729390286532610" target="_blank">tweet </a>that he had discussed the blast with Kuleba, but he did not expand on the details of the conversation.
