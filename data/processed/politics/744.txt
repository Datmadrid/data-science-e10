Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is heading the investigation, is seeking details about phone calls Graham made to top election officials in Georgia amid disproven allegations from then-President Donald Trump about widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election  The Supreme Court’s ruling allowed the grand jury’s subpoena to be enforced, but Graham could refuse to answer questions by invoking his right against self-incrimination under the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment  Graham had argued that he shouldn’t have to offer testimony about the calls because it was part of his duties leading up to Congress’ vote to certify the election results, and therefore the subpoena infringes upon the Constitution’s speech or debate clause that protects lawmakers from investigations over comments they make in their official duties  Willis' office is probing a pair of post-election phone calls Graham made to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff
